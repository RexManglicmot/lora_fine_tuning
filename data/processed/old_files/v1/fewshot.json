Furthermore the motion of the tumor centroid was poorly correlated with the motion of individual points on the tumor boundary indicating significant rotation and or deformation. These studies indicate that image quality and acquisition speed of cine-2D MRI were adequate for motion monitoring. However significant improvements are required to achieve comparable speeds for truly 4D MRI. Despite several challenges rapid MRI offers a feasible and attractive tool for noninvasive long-term motion monitoring. 1. Introduction Respiratory motion causes significant uncertainties in tumor delineation radiotherapy (RT) dose calculations and delivery particularly in the case of thoracic tumors (e.g. lung liver) 1 . The management of respiratory motion has been an active area of research over the last decade. Several investigational as well as clinically implemented respiratory motion management strategies have been described in the literature 1 . However a common limitation of most of these strategies is that they rely on image-guidance techniques that make simplifying assumptions about respiratory motion and do not adequately capture cycle-to-cycle variations which invariably occur in all patients. Modern motion-managed radiotherapy typically uses four-dimensional computed tomography (4DCT) as the tool of choice for pretreatment anatomic imaging (also termed as CT simulation or CT-sim in the literature). In this technique CT projections are acquired over several respiratory cycles from successive slabs in the body. At the same time an external surrogate (e.g. an optical marker) records the amplitude of respiration. Based on the surrogate motion trace the reconstructed slices are sorted into 6 10 volumes over a single respiratory average cycle where each volume represents a specific phase of respiration (inhalation through exhalation) 2 4 . This retrospectively reconstructed movie of a single respiratory cycle serves as the anatomical ground truth for all subsequent stages of radiotherapy (contouring treatment planning and dose delivery). It is well recognized however that respiratory motion is far more complex than can be characterized by a single average cycle. Cycle-to-cycle variations such as baseline shifts and changes in the amplitude and or frequency of the respiratory waveform are inadequately accounted for in 4DCT-based planning and can lead to significant geometric and therefore dosimetric errors 5 . Furthermore binning CT projection data acquired over several cycles into a single cycle leads to severe image artifacts. For example Yamamoto et al. found that 45 of 50 patients had at least one artifact with mean magnitude of 11.6?mm (range: 4.4 56.0?mm) 6 . In a separate study Persson et al. found that 4DCT artifacts caused significant uncertainties in the delineation of the gross tumor volume (GTV) in 16 out of 19 patients 7 . Finally the equivalent dose for 4DCT is quite high (29 40?mSv) about 4 times higher than that for 3DCT (3 10?mSv) 8 . Such high imaging dose discourages long-term monitoring and frequent imaging. Due to these limitations 4DCT-based image guidance provides an incomplete picture of respiration-induced spatial and temporal changes in the thoracic anatomy. The aim of this work is to investigate the feasibility of using rapid magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a nonionizing imaging modality to capture long-term and or frequent information about respiratory motion and its effects on the movement and deformation of lung tumors and surrounding critical ans. The fundamental difference and therefore advantage of cine MRI are that unlike 4DCT the MR image (i.e. slice or volume) is acquired prospectively thereby capturing an actual instance of the patient anatomy which is closer to reality compared to an average estimate of the anatomical state that is represented by 4DCT. Prospective acquisition also enables MRI to overcome the two main challenges that limit the utility of 4DCT images namely the ability to capture cycle-to-cycle variations and elimination of binning-related image artifacts. In addition due to the fact that MRI does not involve ionizing radiation there is no dose penalty for repeated imaging (as opposed to 4DCT). The use of rapid cine-2D as well as 4D MRI for radiotherapy guidance has been previously reported in the literature. In cine-2D MRI a slice of the anatomy is selected at arbitrary orientation and imaged repeatedly in time. 4D MRI is conceptually similar except that in this case an entire volume is selected and imaged. Plathow et al. have reported cine-2D imaging of lung cancer patients at 3 frames per second (fps) 9 and 4D imaging of malignant pleural mesothelioma patients at 1 volume s 10 under slow-breathing conditions using a 1.5?T scanner. Von Siebenthal et al. have reported on a 4D MR imaging technique using retrospective stacking of cine-2D slices 11 . Biederer et al. report 4D MRI of a ventilated chest phantom that uses porcine lung with embedded agarose nodules to simulate tumors 12 . More recently Cai et al. have reported a 4D MRI study of a moving phantom using a technique that uses retrospective sorting of cine-2D slices 13 . To our knowledge there has been no systematic study of rapid lung MRI in the context of image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) motion management under realistic (prospective acquisition free-breathing human subjects) conditions. In this work we present a pilot investigation of prospective rapid cine-2D and cine-3D (commonly termed as 4D in radiotherapy and the MRI literature) MRI of two nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients under free-breathing conditions without externally administered contrast. Subsequently we compute and analyze the motion trajectories of tumors and structures of interest. Our current goal is to demonstrate the feasibility and the utility of rapid MR imaging to monitor respiratory motion over multiple cycles and obtain guidance information about the motion deformation and the interplay between lung tumors and surrounding critical ans. Our long-term goal (beyond the current scope) is to use the information obtained from rapid MRI to augment and potentially correct 4DCT images. 2. Methods 2.1. Imaging of NSCLC Patients Two NSCLC patients were imaged following informed consent. Patient number 1 was a 67-year old female with an 40?mm diameter right midlobe tumor. Patient number 2 was an 80-year old male with an 60?mm diameter left upper-lobe tumor. Both patients were scanned on a 1.5?T scanner (GE Signa). Both patients were scanned in the supine position under free-breathing conditions and without externally administered contrast. For each patient a 4-channel cardiac coil was centered around the tumor. cine-2D time series in the coronal and sagittal planes were acquired using a balanced steady-state free precession (b-SSFP) sequence and the images were reconstructed using the vendor's in-built software. In all cases except one (Patient number 1 coronal series) half-Fourier acquisition was used in order to achieve higher imaging speed. In the case of Patient number 2 an additional 3D t (4D) scan of a tumor-inclusive coronal slab (8 slices each 5?mm thick) was acquired using the b-SSFP sequence in the 3D mode and in conjunction with parallel imaging (acceleration 4). The 4D images were reconstructed using the autocalibrating reconstruction for Cartesian imaging (ARC) algorithm 14 . summarizes the image acquisition parameters for the cine-2D and the 4D acquisitions. 2.2. Motion Analysis For each time series from the motion trajectories of the tumor and structures of interest were determined as follows. A fluid-flow-based deformable image registration previously validated for RT applications 15 17 was applied to each time series to compute deformation vector fields (DVFs) across the temporal dimension. In order to reduce errors and achieve high computation speed (i.e. fewer iterations) the registration was performed in two stages-rigid registration which accounted for gross translation and affine transformations of the tumor and ans followed by deformable registration which accounted mainly for tumor and an deformation. For each time series a reference image was selected (typically at mid-inhale) and 15 points each on the tumor boundary and the diaphragm were manually selected. Subsequently the motion trajectory of each pixel on a contour was determined from the DVFs. The validity of using diaphragmatic motion as a surrogate for tumor motion was examined by calculating the correlation between the average motion trajectory of the pixels comprising the diaphragm boundary with the average trajectory of the pixels comprising the tumor boundary. The presence of complex motion such as tumor rotation and or deformation was tested by comparing the motion trajectory of the tumor centroid with those of the selected points on the tumor boundary. 3. Results and Discussion Figure 1 shows MR images acquired from Patient number 1 (Figures 1(a) and 1(b)) and Patient number 2 (Figures 1(c) and 1(d)). The acquisition times per image ranged from 0.15 to 0.27?s speeds adequate for monitoring most respiratory motion. In each case the tumor mass (indicated by an arrow) can be clearly delineated against the background of lung parenchyma. Figure 2(a) shows a frame from the 4D acquisition from Patient number 2. A surface rendered tumor-inclusive volume-of-interest in four different respiratory phases is shown in Figure 2(b). Both the tumor as well as the surrounding anatomy exhibit significant deformation from phase to phase. Figure 3 shows motion trajectories extracted from two time series one from each patient. MRI-based monitoring over multiple respiratory cycles yields some interesting observations. In the case of Patient number 1 there is little cycle-to-cycle variation in the respiratory pattern as evidenced by the motion trajectory of the diaphragm. Furthermore the motion of the tumor centroid is well correlated with the motion of the diaphragm (Figure 3(a); R2 0.99) indicating that in this case diaphragmatic motion is an appropriate surrogate for tumor motion. Finally the motion of individual points on the tumor boundary (i.e pixels comprising the edges of the tumor mass) is well correlated with that of the tumor centroid (Figure 3(b); R2 0.9 to 1.0) indicating the absence of any significant rotation or deformation in the tumor mass. In the case of Patient number 2 while the respiratory pattern is quite regular (as seen from the motion trajectory of the diaphragm) the motion of the tumor centroid is very poorly correlated with diaphragmatic motion (Figure 3(c); R2 0.16) and shows significant cycle-to-cycle variation. This behavior indicates that in this case diaphragmatic motion is a poor surrogate for tumor motion. Furthermore the motion of the tumor centroid is also relatively poorly correlated with that of individual points on the tumor boundary (Figure 3(d); R2 0.56 to 0.94) indicating the occurrence of significant rotation deformation of the tumor mass. The complex motion observed in Patient number 2 is likely due to the proximity of tumor to the cardiac wall which almost touches the edge of the tumor (Figure 1(c)) and serves as a second actuator of motion (the first being the diaphragm). These results demonstrate that the current clinical practice of using the motion of the diaphragm (or external or internal surrogates for diaphragmatic motion) has significant limitations when the tumor mass is located in the proximity of other moving structures. The goal of this work was to demonstrate the feasibility and the potential advantages of using rapid MRI as a pretreatment image-guidance tool for lung RT. These early results from rapid MRI of NSCLC patients show that for guidance-quality imaging the inherent contrast presented by the tumor mass and critical structures against the signal-poor lung parenchyma enables us to sacrifice SNR in order to achieve adequate acquisition speed to capture respiratory motion. Furthermore in the case of Patient number 2 we observe that through long-term prospective MR imaging one can capture spatiotemporal effects that are not captured by 4DCT. This is due to the fact that 4DCT projections are sorted using an external surrogate for diaphragmatic motion thereby implicitly assuming that a perfect correlation exists between diaphragmatic motion and tumor motion. The choice of a 1.5?T scanner for this work was motivated by the fact that several lung motion investigations have been performed at this field strength 12 18 . Observer studies comparing 1.5?T and 3?T scanners for lung MRI show that there is no significant difference in overall image quality 19 20 suggesting that the expected benefits of higher SNR at 3?T are somewhat mitigated due to the accompanying increase in susceptibility artifacts. Furthermore at this initial stage we chose to use existing coils and sequences. As seen from the results while this strategy was adequate for cine-2D imaging very large improvements in acquisition speed are required for truly 4D MRI. This is evidenced by the fact that even with the use of parallel acceleration 4 the acquisition time for the 4D time series shown in Figure 2 was 1.5?s volume. Thus there is much room for exploration of other rapid MRI sequences and for developing sequences specifically optimized for RT guidance. In particular we expect the largest improvements in imaging speed to come from strategies based on sparse sampling and reconstruction such as k-t Broad-use Linear Acquisition Speed-up Technique (k-t BLAST) and its parallel imaging version k-t SENSitivity Encoding (k-t SENSE). Beyond the current scope it is expected that the information obtained from rapid MRI (cine-2D or 4D) can be merged with that from 3DCT or 4DCT to create a fused pretreatment 4D image that combines the soft-tissue contrast and temporally dense information from MRI with the spatial accuracy and electron density information from CT. Admittedly this is a nontrivial problem because one has to account for MRI artifacts correct for geometric distortions of the anatomy due to the relatively narrow bore of the magnet and develop robust multimodality image registration tools. Furthermore since this was a feasibility study the patients were not asked to lie in the treatment position for the MRI scan. However for future studies which aim to fuse the MRI with CT patients will be required to do so. However if these challenges are addressed fused 4D images would provide a more realistic picture of the behavior of thoracic anatomy over multiple respiratory cycles. Such guidance would enable the development of novel 4D treatment planning paradigms that explicitly account for effects such as baseline shifts and changes in abdominal versus thoracic breathing. Finally several investigators are working on integrated MRI linac designs 21 23 . Online prospective 4D MRI would enable such systems to perform real-time monitoring and potentially real-time beam adaptation. 4. Conclusion We have investigated the feasibility of rapid MRI as a modality for image-based guidance in lung radiotherapy. While the acquisition speeds of cine-2D imaging are adequate for capturing most respiratory motion significant further improvements are required to achieve comparable speeds for truly 4D MRI acquisition. Nevertheless these early results indicate that rapid MRI offers a highly attractive noninvasive imaging tool for respiratory motion management. The ability to perform dose-free long-term monitoring over multiple respiratory cycles yields valuable information that is not currently available with 4DCT. We expect that such image-guidance will lay the groundwork for significantly better respiratory motion management in lung radiotherapy.

While efficacy may be hampered by a narrow therapeutic index the contribution of biological heterogeneity in the response of KRAS mutant NSCLCs to MEKi PI3Ki has been largely unexplored. In this study we find that most human KRAS mutant NSCLC cell lines fail to undergo marked apoptosis in response to MEKi PI3Ki which is key for tumor responsiveness in vivo. This heterogeneity of apoptotic response occurs despite relatively uniform induction of growth arrest. Using a targeted shRNA screen of BCL-2 family members we identify BIM PUMA and BCL-XL as key regulators of the apoptotic response induced by MEKi PI3Ki with decreased expression of BIM and PUMA relative to BCL-XL in cell lines with intrinsic resistance. Additionally by modeling adaptive resistance to MEKi PI3Ki both in vitro and in vivo we find that upon the development of resistance tumors have a diminished apoptotic response due to down-regulation of BIM and PUMA. These results suggest that the inability to induce apoptosis may limit the effectiveness of MEKi PI3Ki for KRAS mutant NSCLC by contributing to intrinsic and adaptive resistance to this therapy.

Here we find that a lymphocyte lineage-restricted transcription factor Aiolos is frequently expressed in lung cancers and predicts markedly reduced patient survival. Aiolos decreases expression of a large set of adhesion-related genes disrupting cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. Aiolos also reconfigures chromatin structure within the SHC1 gene causing isoform-specific silencing of the anchorage reporter p66Shc and blocking anoikis in vitro and in vivo. In lung cancer tissues and single cells p66Shc expression inversely correlates with that of Aiolos. Together these findings suggest that Aiolos functions as an epigenetic driver of lymphocyte mimicry in metastatic epithelial cancers.

However the lower objective response rate and higher adverse effects of vinorelbine hinder its wide use in treatment of advanced NSCLC. Therefore it is of great interest to uncover the biomarkers for sensitivity of NSCLC cells to vinorelbine to allow the identification of patients most likely to benefit from vinorelbine-based chemotherapy and to improve the therapy. In present work four NSCLC cell lines were divided into vinorelbine-sensitive (VS) group and vinorelbine-resistant (VR) group according to their sensitivities to vinorelbine. And then the gene expression profiles of these two groups was compared the differentially expressed genes (expression difference higher than 100 and p 0.05 totally 496 genes) were applied to Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). IPA results showed that NF-?B and PTEN signaling were predicted to be inactivated in VR cell lines which was partially validated by quantitative PCR or western blotting experiments.",

crc world wide is increasing annually with an incidence rate of in chronic inflammation is the leading cause of immune cell infiltration and proliferation and it has been suggested to be a high risk factor for colitis associated crc cac inflammatory bowel disease ibd which encompasses both ulcerative colitis uc and crohn's disease was established as an important precursor to crc for example the incidence of ibd associated crc in patients with uc was reported to have a cumulative risk rate of at years at years and at years of disease duration therefore further in vivo studies are required for researchers to gain an improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms of cac which may provide more exact molecular targets for the diagnosis and treatment of cac during the early stages toll like receptor tlr9 a member of the tlr family is located in the cytoplasm and intracellular endosomes and can be activated by unmethylated bacterial cpg dna the activation of the tlr9 signaling pathway induces a type t helper cell immune response and stimulates the proliferation of b cells thus protecting the host from external microbial invasion multiple studies have revealed that abnormal tlr9 expression levels were involved in the pathogenesis and progression of uc in addition abnormal expression levels of tlr9 were also identified during the tumorigenesis and development of crc nf Îºb is an important transcription factor involved in various biological processes including inflammatory reac tions immune responses apoptosis and proliferation in fact nf Îºb is regarded as a molecular hub that links inflam mation and cancer it was previously suggested that nf Îºb may serve an important role in colorectal carcinogenesis by regulating matrix metalloproteinase expression previous studies have revealed that tlr9 was related to the biological characteristics of various types of cancer including bladder lung and prostate cancer such as cell proliferation invasion tumor growth and

crypt foci then to polyps adenoma and eventually adenocarcinoma it has been reported that individuals with ibd may have an increased risk of developing crc which is directly proportional to the extent and duration of their disease however the exact mechanism and duration required for chronic colitis to develop into adenoma and then adenocarcinoma remains unclear it has been suggested that patients with ibd have an increased risk of crc following the inflammation dysplasia carcinoma model including dysplasia and crc as primary conse quences of chronic inflammation however there are currently still no defined molecular biomarkers or existing monitoring protocols for detecting the occurrence of a malignant tumor except for frequent colonoscopy examinationsin the present study an acute colitis chronic colitis adenoma adenocarcinoma model was successfully constructed via aomdss induction using this model tlr9 expression levels were discovered to be upregulated as the severity of the colorectal lesions increased which indicated that tlr9 protein expression levels may be continuously activated during colitis crc development tlr9 is a critical protein associated with innate and acquired immunity and it has been demonstrated to serve a significant role in the development of colitis and sporadic crc however the mechanism by which tlr9 regulates the devel opment of crc remains to be elucidatedinterestingly ihc analysis revealed that the expression levels of nf Îºb and ki67 were simultaneously upregulated alongside tlr9 expression levels notably inhibiting tlr9 decreased the migration proliferation and viability of ht29 cells in vitro and tlr9 expression levels in vivo were identi fied to be significantly positively correlated with the expression levels of nf Îºb and ki67 a cell proliferation marker during the transition from colitis to crc the present study further revealed that the inhibition of tlr9 in vitro significantly downregulated the expression levels of nf Îºb myd88 pcna and the anti apoptotic protein bcl xl in a dose and time dependent manner notably a previous study reported that tlr9 promoted the tumor propagating potential of prostate cancer cells via nf Îºb signaling thus the findings of the present study indicated that tlr9 may promote cac through nf Îºb signaling however these findings may be controver sial because other previous studies have revealed that tlr9 agonists exerted an antitumor effect in crc the majority of these studies primarily focused on the role of tlr9 in colitis or sporadic crc whereas the current study focused on the role of tlr9 in the pathogenesis of cac to provide novel targets for the treatment of cac for example altera tions in microtubule end binding protein were identified as a characteristic of sporadic but not uc associated crc and in another previous study the immune profiling patterns of patients with cac were significantly different compared with the patients with sporadic crc chloroquine a non specific inhibitor of tlr9 is an old antimalarial drug which has recently attracted significant interest for its potential antitumor properties for example numerous studies have reported that chloroquine directly regu lated cancer cells by inducing apoptosis inhibiting autophagy interacting with nucleotides eliminating cancer stem cells and enhancing the growth of cancer cells chloroquine also inhibited the expression levels of tlr9 by preventing the acidi fication and maturation of the endosomes and the trafficking of tlrs due to the multiple effects of chloroquine on tumor cells different concentrations of chloroquine were selected for use in the present study based on the lowest dose according to previous studies in order to obtain the best possible results with low toxicity to the cells in the future investiga tions using small interfering rna targeting tlr9 should be performed to determine the effect on the biological processes of crc cell lines to further verify the findings of the present study thus our future studies will focus on investigating the precise molecular mechanism by which tlr9 participates in the early occurrence of colorectal carcinogenesisin the present study developed a cac animal model the findings indicated that tlr9 may be closely asso ciated with the process of inflammation dysplasia carcinoma and may impact carcinogenesis by regulating the nf Îºb signaling pathway these results may provide promising potential to be developed into an early detection protocol or therapeutic molecular target for

    "text": "Therefore using the combined sample from the LSC and PLuSS ROC curves were generated using the 3-gene model the full 11-gene model and covariates-only model in male former smokers (Figure 1). Likelihood ratio tests confirmed that both the 3-gene and 11-gene models are significantly more discriminative than the covariates only model (p? ?0.0002 and p? ?0.002 respectively); however the 3- and 11-gene models were not significantly different from each other (p? ?0.29). Areas under the curve (AUC) were 0.74 and 0.80 for the 3- and 11-gene models respectively while the AUC was 0.55 for the covariates only model. Although sample sizes were small in cohort-stratified analyses of male former smokers these analyses demonstrate that the increased discriminative power of the 3-gene model is observed in two independent cohorts (Additional file 1: Figure S1). ROC curves comparing the sensitivity and specificity of 3- and 11-gene methylation panels for classifying CMH. ROC curves were generated by applying logistic regression models to male former smokers (n? ?139) from the combined PLuSS and LSC. The covariates included age pack years education and COPD. AUC is indicated in parentheses. Discussion This study demonstrates a significant association between CMH and prevalence of promoter methylation in sputum of lung cancer risk genes in two geographically distinct cohorts. This association was especially strong in males and in former smokers and SULF2 was the most consistently associated gene. Importantly the overall association between CMH and methylation and the specific effects of sex and smoking status were observed independently in both cohorts. Combining the two cohorts strengthened the statistical significance of these associations. The central finding of our study is that male former smokers with unresolved CMH may be at an increased risk of lung cancer. Given that 50 of persons diagnosed with lung cancer are former smokers prospective studies evaluating the methylation status of former smokers with CMH who subsequently develop lung cancer are needed 26 . The eleven genes examined in this study were selected based on prior evidence that they are associated with lung cancer risk 1718 . Therefore increased prevalence of methylation of these genes may predict lung cancer among subjects with CMH. These gene promoters have all been shown to be methylated in tumors 2728 and are proposed to represent an expanding field of precancerous epigenetic changes in the aerodigestive tract of smokers 1729 . This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the methylation prevalence of these gene promoters increases as the time to lung cancer diagnosis decreases 17 . Mounting evidence indicates that these changes are causal for tumor initiation 30-33 . The association between methylation and CMH was markedly stronger in males than in females (Table 4). Univariate analysis of males and females in both cohorts (Additional file 1: Tables S3 and S4) reveals that females with CMH are significantly younger than female controls in the LSC; however this was not true in the PLuSS. Additionally age was a covariate in all adjusted analyses and thus is unlikely to account for the lack of association between methylation and CMH in females. This apparent protective mechanism in females warrants further study. The association between methylation and CMH was also stronger in former than in current smokers (Table 5). The increase in effect size in former smokers may be due to several reasons: (1) the CMH phenotype in former smokers may not be confounded by cough and phlegm caused by irritation due to current smoking; (2) in susceptible smokers CMH that persists in spite of smoking cessation may represent a phenotype with a more distinct molecular pathology; (3) The association between CMH and gene promoter methylation may be stronger with age. In the LSC and PLuSS cohorts former smokers were significantly older than current smokers (mean age difference 4.2 years data not shown). This age difference between former and current smokers also likely explains the puzzling observation that current smokers have lower overall methylation compared to former smokers (Additional file 1: Table S2); current smokers are younger and younger age is associated with less total methylation in these lung cancer risk genes. Numerous studies have demonstrated that prior CMH significantly increases the risk for later development of lung cancer (reviewed in 1516 ). Assessment of the latency period between diagnosis of CMH and diagnosis of lung cancer has shown that this risk increases with time since diagnosis of CMH 34 . In one study 34 the odds ratio nearly quadrupled at latency 15 years compared to latency 1 5 years. Importantly this suggests that CMH may serve as a precursor to lung carcinogenesis 34 . We hypothesize that the increased prevalence for methylation of the lung cancer risk genes seen in this study may help explain the epidemiological link between CMH and lung cancer. Further studies are needed to establish a direct link between gene methylation and lung cancer. Interestingly while SULF2 p16 JPH3 and PCDH20 all demonstrate evidence for association with CMH in the current study a previous study determined that GATA4 promoter methylation was associated with airflow obstruction 35 . These findings suggest that major differences exist in the genes affected by aberrant promoter methylation in distinct COPD sub-phenotypes. This is consistent with the major pathophysiological differences that underlie emphysema and chronic mucous hypersecretion 36 and suggests the role basal cell hyperplasia may play in development of lung cancer 37 . Of the 11 genes analyzed SULF2 demonstrated the strongest association with CMH. SULF-2 is an extracellular enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of 6-O-sulfo groups from heparan sulfate polysaccharides 38-40 . Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) are widely distributed on cell membranes and the extracellular matrix and serve as coreceptors for many growth factors and cytokines 41 and the position of 6-O sulfates is of particular importance for ligand binding 38-40 . Epigenetic inactivation of SULF2 either by siRNA treatment or promoter methylation activates numerous type I interferon (IFN)-inducible genes 42 . It was proposed that silencing of SULF2 prevents the removal of sulfate groups from IFN-binding sites which may preserve either the binding affinity or bioavailability of interferons leading to increased transcription of multiple IFN-inducible genes 42 . It is plausible that CMH caused by metaplastic mucous cells that are sustained due to dysregulated cell death mechanisms that involve IFN signaling 43-45 creates an inflammatory milieu which causes methylation of SULF2. In turn the type 1 interferon response induced by methylation of SULF2 may help to perpetuate the inflammation associated with CMH. This is the first report of epigenetic changes in the airways of individuals with CMH. Strengths of the study include the use of the large well-characterized LSC for the initial phase of study and excellent replication of all main findings in the geographically distinct PLuSS. We chose the standard definition for chronic bronchitis in the LSC and a definition that most closely captured the standard clinical definition of chronic bronchitis in the PLuSS. While the differences in questionnaires used to define CMH could be considered a limitation in the study the definition for CMH was applied to PLuSS subjects prior to any data analysis and was not subsequently modified. We propose that this approach improves the rigor of our validation.",

    "text": "Ectopic expression of BANCR was achieved through pCDNA-BANCR transfection with an empty pCDNA3.1 vector used as a control. The expression levels of BANCR were detected by qPCR. Cell transfection Plasmid vectors (pCDNA3.1-BANCR and pCDNA3.1) for transfection were prepared using DNA Midiprep or Midiprep kits (Qiagen Hilden Germany) and transfected into SPC-A1 or A549 cells. The siRNAs si-HDAC1 si-HDAC3 si-BANCR or si-NC were transfected into SPC-A1 or A549 cells (Additional file 3: Table S2). A549 and SPC-A1 cells were grown on six-well plates to confluency and transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer s instructions. At 48 h post-transfection cells were harvested for qPCR or western blot analysis. Cell viability assays Cell viability was monitored using a Cell Proliferation Reagent Kit I (MTT) (Roche Applied Science). The A549 cells transfected with si-BANCR (3000 cells well) and A549 or SPC-A1 cells transfected with pCDNA-BANCR were grown in 96-well plates. Cell viability was assessed every 24 h following the manufacturer s protocol. All experiments were performed in quadruplicate. For colony formation assays pCDNA-BANCR-transfected SPC-A1 or A549 cells (n? ?500) were placed in a 6-well plates and maintained in media containing 10 FBS. The medium was replaced every 4 days; after 14 days cells were fixed with methanol and stained with 0.1 crystal violet (Sigma-Aldrich). Visible colonies were then counted. For each treatment group wells were assessed in triplicate. Flow cytometry analysis of apoptosis SPC-A1 and A549 cells were harvested at 48 h post-transfection by trypsinization. After staining with FITC-Annexin V and propidium iodide cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (FACScan; BD Biosciences) using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). Cells were discriminated into viable cells dead cells early apoptotic cells and apoptotic cells. The ratio of early apoptotic cells was compared to that for controls from each experiment. All samples were assayed in triplicate. Wound-healing assay For the wound-healing assay 3? ?105 cells were seeded in 6-well plates cultured overnight and transfected with pCDNA-BANCR or the control vector. Once cultures reached 85 confluency the cell layer was scratched with a sterile plastic tip and washed with culture medium then cultured for 48 h with medium containing 1 FBS. At different time points images of the plates were acquired using a microscope. The distance between the two edges of the scratch was measured using Digimizer software system. Cell migration and invasion assays For the migration assays at 48 h post-transfection 5? ?104 cells in serum-free media were placed into the upper chamber of an insert (8-?m pore size; Millipore). For the invasion assays 1? ?105 cells in serum-free medium were placed into the upper chamber of an insert coated with Matrigel (Sigma-Aldrich). Medium containing 10 FBS was added to the lower chamber. After incubation for 24 h the cells remaining on the upper membrane were removed with cotton wool. Cells that had migrated or invaded through the membrane were stained with methanol and 0.1 crystal violet imaged and counted using an IX71 inverted microscope (Olympus Tokyo Japan). Experiments were independently repeated three times. Tail vein injections into athymic mice Athymic male mice (4-weeks-old) were purchased from the Animal Center of the Chinese Academy of Science (Shanghai China) and maintained in laminar flow cabinets under specific pathogen-free conditions. SPC-A1 cells transfected with pCDNA-BANCR or the empty vector were harvested from 6-well plates washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and resuspended at 2? ?107 cells ml. Suspended cells (0.1 ml) were injected into the tail veins of 9 mice which were sacrificed 7 weeks after injection. The lungs were removed and photographed and visible tumors on the lung surface were counted. This study was carried out in strict accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. Our protocol was approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of Nanjing Medical University (Permit Number: 200933). All surgery was performed under sodium pentobarbital anesthesia and all efforts were made to minimize suffering 37 . Western blotting analysis Cells were lysed using RIPA protein extraction reagent (Beyotime Beijing China) supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche CA USA) and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Roche). The concentration of proteins was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Protein extracts (50 ?g) were separated by 10 sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Sigma) and incubated with specific antibodies. ECL chromogenic substrate was used to visualize the bands and the intensity of the bands was quantified by densitometry (Quantity One software; Bio-Rad) with GAPDH used as a control. Antibodies (1:1000 dilution) against E-cadherin and N-cadherin were purchased from BD. Antibodies against vimentin MMP-2 and MMP-9 were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (MA USA). Fluorescence immunohistochemistry Cells were fixed in 4 paraformaldehyde following a standard protocol. Mouse anti-E-cadherin and -N-cadhherin polyclonal antibodies (1:100; BD) were used as primary antibodies with TRITC-labeled anti-Rabbit IgG (1:200; Sigma) used as a secondary antibody. Sections were mounted onto slides using Gel Mount Aqueous Mounting Medium (G0918 Sigma) and examined with an Olympus BX51 microscope (Olympus Optical Tokyo Japan). Statistical analysis Student s t-test (2-tailed) one-way ANOVA and the Mann Whitney U test were used to analyze data along with SPSS 16.0 (IBM IL USA).

Background Maintenance gefitinib significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) compared with placebo in patients from eastern Asian with locally advanced metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after four chemotherapeutic cycles (21 days per cycle) of first-line platinum-based combination chemotherapy without disease progression. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of maintenance gefitinib therapy after four chemotherapeutic cycle s stand first-line platinum-based chemotherapy for patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with unknown EGFR mutations from a Chinese health care system perspective. Methods and Findings A semi-Markov model was designed to evaluate cost-effectiveness of the maintenance gefitinib treatment. Two-parametric Weibull and Log-logistic distribution were fitted to PFS and overall survival curves independently. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the stability of the model designed. The model base-case analysis suggested that maintenance gefitinib would increase benefits in a 13 6 or 10-year time horizon with incremental 184829 19214 19328 and 21308 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained respectively. The most sensitive influential variable in the cost-effectiveness analysis was utility of PFS plus rash followed by utility of PFS plus diarrhoea utility of progressed disease price of gefitinib cost of follow-up treatment in progressed survival state and utility of PFS on oral therapy.",

Although the protein expression levels of p120ctn were not related to E-cadherin the localization (membrane or cytoplasm) of p120ctn was always consistent with that of E-cadherin. We then screened cells expressing high levels of p120ctn and E-cadherin in the membrane (H460 cells) or cytoplasm (SPC cells) as well as those expressing low levels of p120ctn and E-cadherin in the membrane (H4299 cells) or cytoplasm (LK2 cells) for further study (B). .0088064.g002 Expression and localization of p120ctn and E-cadherin in H460 SPC H1299 and LK2 cells. (A) Western blot analyses showed expression of p120ctn and E-cadherin in nine lung cancer cell lines and HBE. (B) By immunofluorescence analysis the expression of E-cadherin and p120ctn were observed restricted to the cell membrane at cell-cell adherens junctions in H460 and H1299 cells whereas they both were confined to the cytoplasm in SPC and LK2 cells. Different functions of p120ctn isoform 1A in EMT are dependent on E-cadherin subcellular localization Knockdown of endogenous p120ctn isoform 1A by siRNA-p120ctn-1A resulted in decreased E-cadherin expression and increased N-cadherin snail and vimentin expression in H460 cells (A). However knockdown of endogenous p120ctn-1A by siRNA-p120ctn-1A showed opposite results in SPC cells where we found increased E-cadherin expression and decreased N-cadherin snail and vimentin expression (B). In comparison with the control the ablation of p120ctn isoform 1A also enhanced the H460 cells invasiveness (17.33 1.25 vs. 36.33 1.70 P 0.01) (C) whereas reduced the SPC cells invasiveness (23.0 0.82 vs. 13.0 0.82 P 0.01) (D). These results revealed that the p120ctn isoform 1A plays a different role in EMT and cell invasiveness in different E-cadherin subcellular locations. .0088064.g003 p120ctn isoform 1A plays a different role in regulating EMT in H460 and SPC cells. (A) Ablation of p120ctn isoform 1A decreased E-cadherin expression and increased N-cadherin snail and vimentin expression in H460 cells. (B) SPC cells were treated as in (A) and the opposite results were obtained. (C) Ablation of p120ctn isoform 1A enhanced the invasiveness of H460 cells ( P 0.01). (D) Ablation of p120ctn isoform 1A decreased the invasiveness of SPC cells ( P 0.01). Inhibitory function of p120ctn isoform 3A on EMT is not affected by differences in E-cadherin subcellular localization To verify whether p120ctn isoforms 1A and 3A play different roles in regulating EMT their expression plasmids were transiently transfected into lung cancer cells with low expression of p120ctn (H1299 with membrane E-cadherin expression and LK2 with cytoplasmic E-cadherin expression). The western-blot analysis demonstrated that overexpression of the p120ctn isoform 1A led to increased E-cadherin expression and decreased N-cadherin vimentin and snail expression (A); on the contrary the decreased E-cadherin expression and increased N-cadherin vimentin and snail expression were observed in LK2 cells (B). Overexpression of the p120ctn isoform 1A also reduced the H1299 cell invasiveness (52.0 2.65 vs. 33.33 2.64 P 0.01) (C) while enhanced the LK2 cell invasiveness (18.0 0.82 vs. 39.66 2.05 P 0.01) (D).. Overexpression of p120ctn isoform 3A led to increased E-cadherin expression decreased N-cadherin vimentin and snail expression (A 4B) and reduced cell invasiveness (52.0 2.65 vs. 29.66 1.53 P 0.01; 18.0 0.82 vs. 8.33 expression 0.47 P 0.01) (C 4D) in both of these cell lines. These results further confirmed that the p120ctn isoform 1A had a different effect on EMT depending on the subcellular localization of E-cadherin. They also revealed that the p120ctn isoform 3A maintained an inhibitory role in the EMT of lung cancer cells whether E-cadherin was localized to the membrane or the cytoplasm. .0088064.g004 p120ctn isoform 3A maintains the role of inhibitiing EMT independently of E-cadherin localization. (A B) Both H1299 (E-cadherin membrane localization) and LK2 cells (E-cadherin cytoplasmic localization) transiently transfected with the p120ctn isoform 3A plasmid showed increased E-cadherin expression and decreased N-cadherin vimentin and snail expression. (C D) Transient transfection of p120ctn isoform 3A plasmids into H1299 and LK2 cells resulted in decreased cell invasiveness ( P 0.01). (E) E-cadherin remained localized on the membrane in H1299 cells and in the cytoplasm of LK2 cells after transfection of the p120ctn isoform 3A plasmid. Discussion The phenomenon of EMT in tumor cells often leads to decreased cell adhesion and increased mobility and this transition is accompanied by decreased E-cadherin expression and increased expression of N-cadherin vimentin and other mesenchymal biomarkers 3 4 5 6 7 . As an important factor for stabilizing E-cadherin p120ctn plays a role in inhibiting or promoting tumor cell proliferation and invasion that is dependent on whether E-cadherin is expressed or not 16 17 . Furthermore p120ctn isoforms 1A and 3A have shown different effects on E-cadherin expression and tumor cell invasiveness which are based on differences in the localization of E-cadherin 18 . These results strongly suggest that p120ctn most likely regulates the EMT of tumor cells by affecting E-cadherin expression and that p120ctn isoforms 1A and 3A play different roles in EMT expressing E-cadherin in different subcellular locations. We first found that the p120ctn membrane expression was positively correlated with E-cadherin expression and negatively correlated with vimentin expression and lymph node metastasis while the cytoplasmic expression of p120ctn was negatively correlated with E-cadherin expression and positively correlated with vimentin expression and lymph node metastasis by immunohistochemistry. Although these results were consistent with previous studies 13 14 they further suggested that p120ctn likely affects the EMT by influencing the expression of E-cadherin and vimentin and thereby the cell invasion and metastasis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). To confirm the different impacts of p120ctn isoforms 1A and 3A on EMT in cells expressing E-cadherin in different locations we selected H460 and H1299 cells with E-cadherin membrane expression and SPC and LK2 cells with E-cadherin cytoplasmic expression for further analysis. Plasmids expressing the p120ctn isoforms 1A and 3A were constructed and the full-length p120ctn siRNA was synthesized for these experiments. Since the sequence beyond amino acids 1 101 of p120ctn isoform 1A is similar to that of p120ctn isoform 3A 24 25 we could not design an interference sequence specifically for p120ctn isoform 3A. Therefore we had to further study the impact of the two isoforms on EMT and cell invasiveness in lung cancer cells with different E-cadherin locations specifically by knocking down p120ctn isoform 1A in H460 and SPC cells with high p120ctn expression and transfecting cDNA plasmids for exogenous p120ctn isoforms 1A and 3A into H1299 and LK2 cells with low expression of p120ctn. Knockdown of p120ctn isoform 1A in H460 cells destroyed the epithelial cell adhesion complexes. E-cadherin expression was also downregulated due to the loss of its important stabilizing factor p120ctn isoform 1A which was consistent with previous studies 20 26 . Decreased E-cadherin expression and disrupted cell-cell adhesion may induce EMT 27 28 43 44 which results in increased N-cadherin vimentin and snail expression and enhanced cell invasiveness. On the other hand overexpressed p120ctn isoforms 1A and 3A was shown to bind E-cadherin located on the membrane proactively in tumor cells 29 and then inhibit the degradation of E-cadherin and stabilize its expression contributing to the formation of effective epithelial cell adhesion complexes 30 31 32 . As these series of processes maintained the normal cell-cell adhesion connection and inhibited EMT there was increased E-cadherin expression and decreased N-cadherin vimentin and snail expression as well as inhibited cell invasiveness in H1299 cells. Previous studies have shown that although p120ctn isoform 1A could bind E-cadherin in the cytoplasm they could not form effective adhesion complexes on the membrane between epithelial cells 33 . Furthermore the cytoplasmic E-cadherin is likely not to be the full-length E-cadherin but instead cleaved E-cadherin fragments such as E-cad sE-cad (80 kDa) and E-cad CTF2 (33 kDa) 34 . The E-cad CTF2 fragment can bind to p120 in the cytoplasm and then translocate into the nucleus and bind the transcriptional repressor of Kaiso to activate the Wnt b-catenin pathway 35 36 finally promoting the EMT of tumor cells and enhancing cell invasion and metastasis 37 . Moreover others have shown that p120ctn-1A is related to abnormal expression of E-cadherin and poor prognosis 38 . These studies illustrated that the cytoplasmic p120ctn isoform 1A can play a role in promoting tumor cell EMT invasion and metastasis. Based on the above we observed on the one hand that the effect of p120ctn isoform 1A to promote tumor cell EMT invasion and metastasis would be lifted by its ablation resulting in increased E-cadherin expression decreased N-cadherin vimentin and snail expression and inhibited invasiveness in SPC cells. On the other hand transfection of the p120ctn isoform 1A plasmid into LK2 cells expressing cytoplasmic E-cadherin resulted in decreased E-cadherin expression increased N-cadherin vimentin and snail expression and enhanced cell invasiveness. Although the precise role of p120ctn during EMT induction is still unclarified previous studies suggested that knockdown of all isoforms of p120ctn could induce EMT indirectly 27 28 43 44 . All inductions were based on decreased E-cadherin expression and intercellular adhesion in previous studies which were also confirmed by our study in H460 cells with E-cadherin membrane localization. Unlike the H460 cells knockdown of the p120ctn isoform 1A in SPC cells with E-cadherin cytoplasmic expression could not decrease E-cadherin expression and intercellular adhesion. Instead we found increased E-cadherin expression and decreased cell invasiveness indicating that the EMT could not be induced by this pathway in SPC cells. It was worth noting that the same result was observed in LK2 and H1299 cells transfected with the p120ctn isoform 3A plasmid both showing increased E-cadherin expression decreased N-cadherin vimentin and snail expression and inhibited cell invasiveness. These results suggested that p120ctn isoform 3A has the function of inhibiting EMT of lung cancer cells and this function is independent of the cellular E-cadherin localization. Past research had also confirmed a shift from p120ctn isoform 3A to p120ctn isoform 1A expression after the induction of EMT 9 10 11 which indirectly indicates that p120ctn isoform 3A may inhibit EMT while p120ctn isoform 1A promotes EMT. In addition we also noticed that p120ctn and E-cadherin protein expression levels were significantly increased after transfection of the p120ctn-3A plasmid into LK2 and H1299 cells but p120ctn and E-cadherin were still mainly restricted to the cell membrane at cell-cell adherens junctions in H1299 cells. By contrast E-cadherin and p120ctn were almost exclusively located in the cytoplasm in LK2 cells (E). As a cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin is known to be only located on the cell membrane with the potential to inhibit EMT while in the cytoplasm it is often cleaved into fragments and therefore functions differently from the molecules located on the cell membrane 34 . Thus the cytoplasmic E-cadherin would theoretically not play a role in inhibiting EMT. Based on the above analysis we speculated that there may be some interaction between p120ctn isoform 3A and snail which plays a role in suppressing EMT in lung cancer cells expressing cytoplasmic E-cadherin but this hypothesis requires further study. Importantly we also found that knockdown of p120ctn-1A in SPC cells with cytoplasmic E-cadherin resulted in decreased twist expression (B). Meanwhile transfection of LK2 cells which also showed cytoplasmic localization of E-cadherin with the p120ctn isoform 1A plasmid resulted in increased twist expression (B). However no changes in twist expression were observed in the rest of the experiments (A 4A). As a transcription factor and master gene regulator of EMT 39 40 twist can downregulate E-cadherin expression 41 and upregulate N-cadherin and other mesenchymal biomarkers 42 . Increased twist expression in LK2 cells transfected with the p120ctn isoform 1A plasmid indicated that transcriptional activation took place and further suggested that the p120ctn isoform 1A may have translocated into the nucleus upon binding of E-cad CTF2 in the cytoplasm consequently activating the Wnt signaling pathway to promote EMT. Decreased twist expression in SPC cells transfected with p120ctn-1A-siRNA indicated that transcriptional activity was downregulated and suggested that ablation of p120ctn isoform 1A resulted in the inhibtion of EMT by removing the stimulatory effect of the Wnt signaling activity by p120ctn isoform 1A. In the H460 and H1299 cells with E-cadherin localized in the membrane the unchanged twist expression confirmed that p120ctn isoforms 1A and 3A could bind to E-cadherin and maintain effective cell-cell adhesion in order to suppress EMT instead of affecting the Wnt twist pathway. Intriguingly overexpression of p120ctn isoform 3A did not change twist expression in LK2 cells expressing cytoplasmic E-cadherin indicating that p120ctn isoform 3A did not activate transcription. Therefore we firmly believe in the above hypothesis that p120ctn isoform 3A may interact with snail in some manner to influence E-cadherin expression and suppress EMT in lung cancer cells carrying cytoplasmic E-cadherin. Previous studies have observed that p120ctn-1A restored the cytoplasmic expression of E-cadherin whereas p120ctn-3A could not 20 which seems to be contradictory with the results of this study. However the method in previous studies of knocking down p120ctn expression and then transfecting p120ctn isoforms 1A and 3A plasmids into cells is different from that in the current study in which cells were only transiently transfected with p120ctn isoforms 1A and 3A plasmids. Therefore the different research methods may have led to different effects on E-cadherin. We also noted that in previous studies decreased and almost undetectable levels of E-cadherin by ablation of p120ctn resulted in the failure of exogenous p120ctn-1A to translocate into the nucleus to activate the Wnt b-catenin pathway and decrease E-cadherin expression due to the deletion of the binding partner E-cad CTF2. However the LK2 and H1299 cell lines used in these experiments expressed E-cadherin in the present study. E-cadherin binds primarily to unphosphorylated p120ctn isoform 3A whereas tyrosine-phosphorylated p120ctn isoform 1A interacts exclusively with N-cadherin 23 . In the previous studies exogenous p120ctn isoform 3A was prevented from binding and stabilizing E-cadherin after its ablation while in the present study the exogenous p120ctn isoform 3A could stabilize E-cadherin expression directly on the membrane or indirectly by increasing its cytoplasmic expression via regulation of snail expression. Of course all of these findings will need to be further investigated. In conclusion we for the first time found that p120ctn isoforms 1A and 3A to have different functions in EMT of lung cancer cells with E-cadherin expressed in different subcellular locations. When E-cadherin was localized on the cell membrane p120ctn isoforms 1A and 3A both could inhibit EMT and reduce the cell invasiveness phenotype.",

first reports of Coronavirus Disease COVID in Wuhan China the infection had spread worldwiderapidly and COVID19 has reached pandemic levels InSouth Korea since its outbreak in February COVID has affected profoundly every aspect of communities Thehumantohuman transmission of COVID19 provides challenges for all healthcare facilities and healthcare providersIn the face of the COVID19 pandemic the Korean Societyof Nuclear Medicine KSNM Korean Society of InfectiousDisease KSID and Korean Society for HealthcareAssociated Infection Control and Prevention KOSHIC haveprepared the guidance for the nuclear medicine department tominimize confusion and ensure that nuclear medicine physicians and technicians continue to provide their services whileprotecting the patients and workers and preventing the transmission of the virus The Quality Control Committee ofKSNM reviewed several reports and recommendations previously published by the European Association of NuclearMedicine EANM Society of Nuclear Medicine andMolecular Imaging SNMMI American Society of NuclearCardiology ASNC International Atomic Energy AgencyIAEA and others This guidance is basically in compliance with the COVID19 guidelines of the Korea Centersfor Disease Control and Prevention KCDC Finallythis document was prepared in cooperation with KSID andKOSHIC KSNM emphasize that this guidance must be considered in the context of following the state and hospital infection control policies and flexibly applied according tochanges in circumstances and evidenceGeneral Principles During COVID19PandemicIn a pandemic situation such as COVID19 if necessarythe condition of the scheduled patient can be checked inadvance to adjust the examination schedule Nonurgent elective studies or therapy should be postponed in COVID19confirmed or COVID19suspectedpatients Rescheduling the studiestherapy must be donein a discussion with the referring clinicians Only urgent studies or therapy could be performed inCOVID19confirmed or COVID19suspected patientswhenever clinically appropriate The priority of studytherapy should be based on a casebycase indepth discussion between nuclear medicine physicians and referring clinicians In case of performing the urgent studiestherapy consult with the infection control offices of eachinstitution to comply with the infection control rules ofownNucl Med Mol Imaging COVID19suspected patients should undergo COVID testing before performing the studiestherapy Lung ventilation scan should not be performed in anyCOVID19confirmed or COVID19suspected patients Lowdose radioiodine therapy may be considered in caseof acute hyperthyroidism patients who are unable to tolerate antithyroid medications As lowdose radioiodinetherapy lower than GBq of I131 can be performedin an outpatient setting in South Korea COVID19infected patient can be administrated lowdoseradioiodine in the isolation room or negative pressureroom without any additional monitoring related toradioiodine therapyConsideration During the StudyTherapy Patient transportationScheduling COVID19confirmed or COVID19suspected patient as last study of the day to preventcrossinfection in the nuclear medicine department Ensure that other patients or caregivers should notaccess the nuclear medicine department to minimizethe exposure to COVID19 patient during the studytherapy Transfer the COVID19infected patient to the nuclear medicine department using negative pressuretransport bag to minimize exposure and contact todroplet COVID19 patients should wear masks at all timesof procedures If necessary add gowns gloves etc Devices and scanner management Mainly use disposable instruments or items Do notreuse disposable items such as oxygen masks nasalprongs suction tubes or suction lines The protocolfor reusable devices is as follows Cleaning After use the equipment contaminated with blood bodyfluids secretions and feces should be delivered to awashing room with care not to contaminate the surrounding environment The washing place should be separated from the spaceused for cleaning other items or other patients After immersing the contaminated equipment in a washing spacewash the product carefully to avoid splashing Wash enough to remove blood body fluids secretionsand feces from remaining 0cNucl Med Mol Imaging Staff undertaking cleaning should wear KF94 or

clinicians using pd1pd l1 inhibitors should be aware of thiscancer cells however facilitating immune mediated activation is not benign and patients receiving icis are known to exhibit unique toxicities that result in an damage known as immune related adverse events iraes3 the most common iraes with pd1 and pd l1 inhibitors are fatigue pruritus and diarrhoea4 some iraes can be fatal with pneumonitis hepatitis neurotoxicity and most commonly myocarditis reported5 while counterintuitive when the mechanism of action is considered an emerging and increasingly reported toxicity of pd1 and pd l1 inhibitors is acute tuberculosis tb and reactivation of tb6 the first case of tb due to the pd1 inhibitor was described in a patient with relapsed hodgkin s lymphoma who developed pulmonary tb following treatment with pembrolizumab7 since then there have been other case reports of tb following initiation of pd1 or pd l1 inhibitors that make the development of tb a relevant concern8 in a

time to diagnosis from ici initiation was months range to months17 the mechanism by which a pd1pd l1 inhibitor results in tb is not clear in a murine study pd1 knockout mice had decreased survival compared with wild type mice following exposure to mycobacterium tuberculosis furthermore pd1 inhibition is needed to prevent cd4 t cells from promoting development of tb18 pd1 inhibition mitigates over production of interferon gamma ifnÎ³ which is important for host resistance to tb19increased risk of tb and ami is also found in patients on tumor necrosis factor tnf alpha inhibitors and janus

inhibitors screening for latent tb is recommended20 if the patient is found to have latent tb treatment with isoniazid is recommended as it substantially reduces the risk of developing tb reactivation23 however a recent study suggests that pd1 inhibition induced tb reactivation is actually driven by tnf alpha and use of tnf alpha inhibitor could reverse this complication24 there are currently no recommended screening guidelines for latent tb prior to starting pd1pd l1 inhibitors a single institution study in germany found that of patients had positive test for quantiferon gold tb

limitations in ror estimate ae reporting for a drug may be influenced by extent of use publicity and bias25 although the use of disproportionality analysis through pharmacovigilance databases to

pharyngitis which can cause immunemediated and postinfectious complications The recent global pandemic of coronavirus disease COVID19 encourages the use of telemedicine for patients with respiratory symptoms This study therefore purposes automated detection of severe pharyngitis using a deep learning framework with selftaken throat images Methods A dataset composed of two classes of throat images with pharyngitis and normal throat images was collected Before the training classifier we constructed a cycle consistency generative adversarial network CycleGAN to augment the training dataset The ResNet50 Inceptionv3 and MobileNetv2 architectures were trained with transfer learning and validated using a randomly selected test dataset The performance of the models was evaluated based on the accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ROC AUC Results The CycleGANbased synthetic images reflected the pragmatic characteristic features of pharyngitis Using the synthetic throat images the deep learning model demonstrated a significant improvement in the accuracy of the pharyngitis diagnosis ResNet50 with GANbased augmentation showed the best ROCAUC of for pharyngitis detection in the test dataset In the 4fold crossvalidation using the ResNet50 the highest detection accuracy and ROCAUC achieved were and respectively Conclusion The deep learning model for smartphonebased pharyngitis screening allows fast identification of severe pharyngitis with a potential of the timely diagnosis of pharyngitis In the recent pandemic of COVID19 this framework will

Japanese and English languages The most recent image from the database search was achieved on April Images that were not taken with smartphones were manually picked and excluded for this study Images with the characteristics of either pharyngitis or normal throat were manually classified by two clinicians and the ambiguous images were excluded to clarify the image domains Finally we collected the initial dataset with two classes including throat images with pharyngitis and normal throat images The dataset was randomly separated into training N validation N and test sets N to apply deep learning to an independent dataset Detailed data distribution and augmentation are described in Table Only the throat and tonsils images were used for the input data without further manipulation to reduce the intraclass variance Original images were extracted from the database in the PNG Portable Network Graphics format The images were resampled to a pixel resolution of in the PNG formatfor CycleGAN and deep learning models All procedures were performed in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and national research committee and the Helsinki declaration and its later

learning model are available at Mendeley Data repositories 10176328ynyhnj2kz TK Yoo transmission There have been several approaches adopting deep learning for automated diagnosis of several diseases using images captured by smartphones Pharyngitis which is diagnosed in more than million patients in the United States annually is a common condition associated with acute upper respiratory tract infection Pharyngitis is an inflammation of the back of the throat and tonsils Sore throat caused by pharyngitis is one of the main causes of medical visits for young patients The most common cause of acute pharyngitis is a selflimiting viral infection However Streptococcus pyogenes is the major bacterial infectious cause of pharyngitis and is responsible for an estimated of cases of sore throat Frequently severe pharyngitis with fever and exudative tonsillitis is associated with streptococcal pharyngitis which can cause immunemediated and postinfectious complications such as acute rheumatic fever Therefore timely diagnosis of pharyngitis for treatment is important to reduce symptoms fever and complications However many patients with upper respiratory infection ignore their symptoms in the early stage and medical visits do not routinely take place Moreover in recent days many patients hesitate to visit clinics because of the COVID19 outbreak The importance of a mobilebased monitoring system for patients with acute upper respiratory infections has been raised because of its applicability and effectiveness A previous study endeavored to collect throat images using additional equipment in conjunction with the smartphone and used the knearest neighbor algorithm in color distribution space to classify images with streptococcal tonsil However the need for additional equipment limited their effectiveness of this method in a realworld setting Moreover color distribution was unable to represent the characteristic features of pharyngitis Throat images exhibit variation in the size illumination and shape of the oral cavity Here we present a deep learning model with smartphonebased throat images facilitating the detection of severe pharyngitis using selftaken throat images Fig We performed automated detection of severe pharyngitis using a convolutional neural network CNN framework Methods Data collection The basic concept of our framework is throat examination using a selftaken smartphone image with computeraided diagnosis system which is similar to the previous dermatology study This study was performed using publicly accessible selftaken throat images on the web We collected throat images from webbased social QA systems including Naver Korea kinnavercom and Yahoo Japan chiebukuroyahoocojp The additional throat image datasets were extracted using the Google image search engine Most throat Data augmentation using GAN Because of the limited number of datasets and their imbalanced distribution data augmentation is required for deep learning training Basic data augmentation techniques such as flip translation rotation and brightness change have been applied to train deep learning models Several previous studies have attempted to train deep learning models using generative adversarial network GANbased synthetic images to increase the classification performance Inspired by previous works using a generative adversarial network we adopted the CycleGANbased data augmentation to increase the accuracy of diagnosis The cycle consistency in Fig allows CycleGAN to capture the characteristics of two image domains and automatically learn how these characteristics should be translated to transfer to domains without any paired datasets CycleGAN was developed to overcome the limitations of paired data when two generators and two discriminators are used It is considered to be a powerful technique that performs image domain transfer and face transfer Previous studies have demonstrated that CycleGAN can improve deep learning models by generating training situations to learn better decision boundaries between classes We built the CycleGAN augmentation model to increase the Fig Workflow of building a deep learning model for pharyngitis diagnosis using a smartphone ComputersinBiologyandMedicine12520201039802 0cTK Yoo Fig Schematics of the CycleGAN model generating new normal images and pathologic throat images with pharyngitis generalizability of the dataset and to improve the classification performance in the imbalanced dataset Before training the CycleGAN the throat images were augmented using linear transformation including left and right flip width and height translation from to random rotation from to zooming from to and random brightness change from to We defined these transformations as the basic augmentation step In this step normal throat and pharyngitis images were randomly sampled for the training set and normal throat and pharyngitis images were randomly sampled for the validation set Using the data with basic augmentation we trained the CycleGAN models to transform both normal to pharyngitis throat images and pharyngitis to normal images The trained CycleGAN model augmented the training set normal throat and pharyngitis images before augmentation and a total of throat images including normal and pharyngitis images were prepared to train the diagnostic classifier model after CycleGANbased augmentation It should be noted that supervised GAN techniques including conditional GAN and Pix2px were unable to be applied in this study because of a lack of paired normal and pharyngitis images To use a verified and predesigned image generator all the input images required resizing to a pixel resolution of which is the basic setup of a CycleGAN Therefore we used the default parameter settings that is the ADAM optimizer with a batch size of to optimize the GAN networks Development of CNN model We trained conventional deep learning models after data augmentation Because of a small image dataset in this study developing a custom deep learning method is challenging due to difficulty and time consuming eg a small training dataset can easily result in an over fitted model and low performance To overcome the problem of the small dataset transfer learning was widely used to train deep learning models using pretrained architectures This study also applied pretrained learning models to the classification task of throat images The last fully connected layer of the CNNs was only trained and the study used the pretrained conventional model as a feature extractor The CNN models including ResNet50 Inceptionv3 and MobileNet v2 were adopted to build binary classifiers These CNN models have been used successfully in many studies demonstrating stateoftheart performance with the saliency map The models were trained using the training set and the validation set was used to estimate how well the model had been trained We downloaded the CNN models which were pretrained on the ImageNet database and performed finetuning of the weights of the pretrained networks This process generally maintains the weights of some bottom layers to avoid overfitting and performs delicate modification of the highlevel features To use the images generated by CycleGAN the size of the input images for the deep learning models was set to a pixel resolution of and the images were resized for each pretrained model Most conventional deep learning models adopted a pixel resolution of or One deep learning research showed that the best performance was achieved at an image resolution of between and pixels for binary classification Therefore the resolution of our study was appropriate to detect pharyngitis in a binary decision The model was trained with epochs and a batch size of The ADAM optimizer with a learning rate of was also used with a crossentropy loss for all CNN models The crossentropy loss function is defined as Lcross entropy cid0 Nipi logqi Where pi represents the ground truth value and qi represents predicted probability value from a classifier for the ith image The optimizer updated the network parameters to minimize the loss function In our experiments it tuned a fully connected layer of the CNN models For example the first layers of ResNet50 were left frozen and we trained the last fully connected layer using the training dataset which is described in Table the ADAM optimizer We chose the final classifier model which maximized the accuracy in the validation dataset To visualize the clusters to see if the classes are separable by a considerable margin the tdistributed stochastic neighbor embedding t SNE algorithm was executed using sampled instances The feature vectors from the last layer of the pretrained Inceptionv3 model were extracted to train the tSNE As there is a growing demand for explainable artificial intelligence methods in medicine we adopted githubcomjacobgilpytorch the

attention map The GradCAM visualizes the decisional areas of the CNN model using the gradients of any target flowing into the final convolutional network The heatmap has a low resolution and it was upsampled via bicubic interpolation Finally it produces heatmaps that highlight the area of interest and interprets the decision of the deep learning models The performance of the CNN models was evaluated based on the accuracy and area under the curve AUC of the receiver operating characteristic curve ROC and the precisionrecall curve PRC The Youden index which is an estimate of the optimal diagnostic threshold was adopted in this study After obtaining the sensitivity and specificity the Youden index was calculated at each cutoff point We selected the optimal value which maximized the Youden index These performance indexes are expressed as follows Accuracy TP TNTP TN FP FN Sensitivity Recall TPTP FNSpecificity Precision TNTN FPTPTP FP Youden index Sensitivity Specificity cid0 Where TP TN FP and FN denote true positives true negatives false positives and false negatives respectively We also performed a 4fold crossvalidation using the entire dataset to evaluate a generalized performance Google Colab Pro a cloud service for disseminating the deep learning research was adopted to implement the CycleGAN and CNN models Google Colab Pro provides a development environment using the Tensorflowbased deep learning libraries and a robust graphic processing unit GPU This enables the rapid processing of a heavy deep learning network without the need for a personal GPU The available hardware for each virtual machine varied by session but typically included top products of NVIDIA GPUs K80 T4 or P100 around GB of RAM and GB of free space on the virtual machine hard drive We used the Colab CycleGAN tutorial page to develop and validate the CycleGAN model and all of the code is available on the Tensorflow webpage wwwtensorflowtutorialsgene rativecyclegan We only modified the input pipeline to import our dataset The code of the CycleGAN and CNN models is presented in Supplementary Material Results We developed a deep learning model using GANbased augmentation in the challenging context of pharyngitis detection To build a balanced training dataset the CycleGAN models generated normal and pathologic throat images using the initial training dataset The color intensity distributions of the pharyngitis and normal throat images were not significantly different although most throat images had exudate regions Fig A The tSNE algorithm demonstrates that both groups are clustered and they are separable by a considerable margin Fig B The final CycleGAN model for the pharyngitis throat image was trained for epochs which required h After training normal throat images were translated into pathologic images and throat images with pharyngitis were translated into normal images Finally we constructed a balanced augmented training dataset including normal and pharyngitis images using CycleGAN The CycleGANbased synthetic images were realistic and reflected the characteristic features of pharyngitis Fig A The CycleGAN model synthesized white or gray patches and increased the redness on the throat wall and tonsils from normal images Fig B Generated throat images were reviewed by three clinicians including an otolaryngologist and an anesthesiologist All pharyngitis images generated were deemed by the three clinicians to show more pathologic and inflammatory results when compared to the original images This feature generation based on the CycleGAN model can be effective for generating a new sample to increase the intra class variation and generalizability The CNN models were trained using the final augmented dataset via the transfer learning technique Fig demonstrates the training process of the ResNet50 CNN model using the training and validation sets The training process for CNN took approximately h for epochs with finetuning for each training step After the 200th epoch the validation accuracy was not improved and the crossentropy of the validation result increased Therefore we considered that training for epochs was optimal in the ResNet50 model and selected the trained model at the 200th epoch Fig A shows the training validation and test datasets of CNN models with and without CycleGANbased augmentation The ROCAUCs of ResNet50 Inceptionv3 and MobileNetv2 without GAN based augmentation were and respectively Fig B We obtained the best ROCAUC of pharyngitis detection using ResNet50 with GANbased augmentation corresponding to Fig C At the optimal diagnostic cutoff value the ResNet50 model predicted pharyngitis with an accuracy of sensitivity of and specificity of The ROCAUC of Inceptionv3 and MobileNetv2 corresponded to and respectively The models with GAN based augmentation demonstrated superior performance in comparison with the models with only basic augmentation We also evaluated the performance of the models using PRCs Fig The PRCAUC also demonstrated that deep learning models with GANbased augmentation had better performance than those without GANbased augmentation ResNet50 with GANbased augmentation predicted pharyngitis with the highest PRCAUC of When a custom deep learning network without the transfer learning technique was trained the validation accuracy was lower than and was not improved during the training epochs Supplementary materials Table shows the performance of CNN models via 4fold cross validation in the entire dataset A similar tendency is observed for the average accuracy and AUC values in the crossvalidation The result shows that the highest detection accuracy and ROCAUC achieved were and respectively by using the ResNet50 Other CNN models showed lower performance than the ResNet50 with GANbased augmentation but there were no significant differences between CNN models in the 4fold crossvalidation A saliency map using the Grad CAM technique was generated to visualize the characteristic pathologic features of pharyngitis for the predicted evidence Fig A In normal throat images however some regions were highlighted Fig B When synthesized images were tested using the trained model synthesized exudates were highlighted correctly in the images as shown in Fig C Furthermore external clinical cases from previous literature were

throat images C Synthesized images smartphone to obtain throat images We utilized selftaken throat images without additional equipment using deep learning techniques for the detection of pharyngitis We showed that the trained GAN models were able to generate new realistic synthetic throat images which can improve the diagnostic accuracy The final deep learning model achieves high accuracy for automated diagnosis of pharyngitis using smartphone images Therefore this framework could be targeted toward patients with a sore throat who need screening for severe pharyngitis We believe that our study could be extended to computeraided diagnosis using images from an endoscope system in otolaryngology clinics similar to what has been done with colonoscope images using a deep learning model To the best of our knowledge no study has been performed to detect pharyngitis based on deep learning using smartphone images However it should be noted that this study is considered as only a preliminary and proofofconcept study because of its technical limitations due to using only Google Colab The current study framework is similar to that of Chamier which showed a deep learning framework using Google Drive and training and prediction on Google Colab Our proposed conceptual workflow is shown in Fig It needs the Flask servers and interfaces implemented using HTML and JavaScript to be applied in a real clinical setting This work could be part of a larger project to enable smartphonebased pharyngitis detection via a cloudbased applevel mobile data analysis We believe that a future appbased model can provide a robust solution for the costeffective and convenient screening of pharyngitis in a telemedicine setting We have highlighted the feasibility of a smartphonebased approach with deep learning to detect pharyngitis Our approach does not require Fig Classification results from the deep learning model applied to clinical cases with severe pharyngitis A An 81yearold man with odynophagia B A 41yearold diabetic man with throat pain Fig Example of a proposed smartphonebased system for pharyngitis detection ComputersinBiologyandMedicine12520201039807 0cexplored clinical datasets and webbased datasets and showed that the labeling of webbased images is often uncertain Therefore further clinical datasets with validation will be required to confirm the effectiveness of our framework Fourth because we collected only throat images via image search engines there was no metadata including gender race season or age According to a previous epidemiologic study these factors could affect the pharyngitis detection performance Fifth although the datasets were reviewed by authors images could be potentially duplicated in the dataset The duplicated images would affect the independence of the validation dataset We have shown the feasibility of deep learning for the detection of tonsil swelling and exudates in throat images The limitations of our study should be overcome by the availability of a sufficient number of throat images taken by a smartphone with a wellanized study protocol To validate the effectiveness of our framework a prospective study with many patients should be performed in a clinic once the app based framework is developed This will solve the problem of possible duplicated images in the dataset and the absence of metadata Conclusion TK Yoo additional equipment to collect throat images and we collected self taken images using a smartphone The use of webbased image capture of users from various devices and GANbased image augmentation may allow robust image processing While in the current study the implementation was performed on a desktop computer and the Colab s remote server a smartphone application will also be possible to perform this identification for detecting pharyngitis The light deep learning models such as MobileNet can be executed on a smartphone without transmitting the images to a server Our result demonstrates that MobileNetv2 also has a high diagnostic performance similar to ResNet50 and Inceptionv3 In future research an increased amount of training data is needed to improve the detection accuracy using light models The utility of deep learning and smartphones may facilitate the widespread adoption of telemedicine and physical examination platforms via our approach Furthermore the presented framework enabled using a smartphone camera and deep learning techniques will help the patients in selfscreening for severe pharyngitis and may accelerate diagnostic support in remote healthcare services Because of the recent pandemic of COVID19 patients with respiratory symptoms need selfmonitoring to evaluate their pathologic status Advances in technology will require clinicians to embrace remote healthcare services The framework presented in this paper was designed for the timely diagnosis of pharyngitis for treatment Similar smartphoneimagebased diagnostic approaches have been introduced in several other medical image domains including skin diseases hematologic diseases oral diseases and eye diseases The

variation of caesarean section rates were calculated in six studiesdiscussionalmost four decades have past and studies werepublished following opit s first report on variation ofcaesarean section rates between geographic areas inaustralia clearly the issue raised by the first studies hasnot lost its sense of urgency among researchers nor forthe funders of research because the magnitude of unwarranted variation was considered problematic andremained stable over time while previous reviewsnarrowed their focus on measuring variation betweengeographic areas or studied the difference between public and private hospitals the focus of thisreview was on the presence of study characteristics thatmay help to reduce unwarranted variation of caesareansection ratesstrengths and limitationsa strength of our review was the systematic search andselection procedure which allowed us to identify almost all studies on medical practice variation that compared caesarean section rates this resulted in a largenumber of included studies a second strength is thehigh level of detail of our analysis the selection of theindividual variables that were used for casemix correction outcomes or determinants enabled us to present anindepth overview of study characteristicsseverallimitations should be addressed first weaimed to describe study characteristics of all relevantpublished studies ie irrespective of the quality in theenglish language and therefore did not perform a qualityassessment of the included studies second we were unable to retrieve all publications that were selected forfulltext screening in order to limit the number of missing s we contacted the authors of missing sby email or through researchgate however this wasnot successful for of the studiesinterpretationfirst we appraised whether studies were designed to distinguish between warranted and unwarranted practicevariation by performing casemix correction and analysing patient preference casemix correction is an essential aspect of the quality of studies on practice variationbecause without casemix correction it remains unclearwhat share of the variation is attributable to health differences between populations and thus to what extentthe variation is warranted our results show that only of the studies that compared caesarean section ratesbetween healthcare providers performed casemix correction casemix correction was performed by calculating adjusted rates expected rates stratified odds ratiosor logistic regression analysis over time we observed noimprovement in the performance of casemix correctionpatient preference another important aspect to identify unwarranted practice variation was only measured insix studies without the assessment of patient preference it remains unclear whether practice variation canbe explained by differences in the outcome of shared decision making this is especially important when bothmodes of delivery vaginal delivery and caesarean section are an acceptable option patients with a historyof caesarean section breech or twin delivery are examples in which information on patient preference is necessary to differentiate between warranted and unwarrantedmedical practice variation our results show 0cvink bmc pregnancy and childbirth page of that none of studies that assessed variation in these specific obstetric situations patient preference was analysedto improve the identification of unwarranted practicevariation future studies should not only measure patientpreference but should focus on the implementation ofshared decision making recent literature shows thatseveral shared decision making measures are availablewhich could be included in the study design of medicalpractice variation studies to improve comparability both within healthcare facilities and between them robson proposed what latercame to be known as the robson classification systemfor assessing monitoring and comparing caesarean section rates in the who and the figo jointly endorsed this classification as the international standardfor casemix correction our data show that following the publication of this guideline by the who in the robson classification was only used in of all studies comparing providers and in studies comparing regions literature shows that casemixcorrection can be improved even more if additional patient characteristics are considered only of thestudies that were published between and andused the robson classification did perform additionalcasemix correction ie age adjusted caesarean sectionrates within robson groups studies that performedcasemix correction with or without robson classification used a wide variation of maternal and obstetriccharacteristics to identify unwarranted practice variation we advise to at least use the robson classificationand to standardise variables for additional casemix correction a delphi procedure can help obstetricians andmidwives to reach consensus on which variables to use the necessity to which casemix correction is neededdepends on the level of aggregation the lower the levelof aggregation the more case mix correction contributesto a valid description of clinical performance health care providers often operate in a network andtreat a subset of the entire population that subset ismore likely to differ between providers as they get morespecialized and the casemix differences may justify differences in caesarean section rates this requiresthat studies aimed at lower levels of aggregation placemore emphasis on casemix correction reporting standards and appropriate small number statistics once casemix has been appropriately controlled forfuture studies should aim to decompose regional unwarranted variation into lower levels of aggregation thisdecomposition allows regional variation to be attributedto health care providers however disaggregation ofcontributions to lower levels of aggregation is not without major risk on its

influence physiology and disease and how the social constructs of gender affect the behaviour of the community clinicians and patients in the healthcare system and interact with pathobiology We aim to guide clinicians and researchers to consider sex and gender in their approach to diagnosis prevention and treatment of diseases as a necessary and fundamental step towards precision medicine which will benefit men s and women s healthIntroductionWhat clinicians know about the diagnosis treatment and prevention of disease originates from studies mostly done on male cells male mice and men1 Historically for multiple reasons including the purported safety of women and their offspring women of childbearing age were excluded from clinical trials As a result medical research and care have been centred on male physiology The assumption was that male and female cells and animals were biologically identical and evidencebased medicine was defined by clinical trials done predominantly in men1 In the US National Institutes of Health NIH mandated the inclusion of women in NIHfunded clinical trials but many investigators did not follow this mandate and many of those who did include women did not analyse the results by sex23 minimising the effectiveness of this policy Preclinical research and drug development studies have also predominantly used male animal models and cells4 It is not surprising that a US Government Accountability Office report found that eight of the ten prescription drugs withdrawn from the market between and posed greater health risks for women than for men Most funding agencies from Europe and North America have implemented policies to support and mandate researchers to consider sex and gender at all levels of medical research8 Still the field of sexbased biology and medicine is often viewed as a specialised area of interest rather than a central consideration in medical research Essential for the success of clinical care and translational science is awareness by clinicians and researchers that the diseases they are treating and studying are characterised by differences between women and men in epidemiology pathophysiology clinical manifestations psychological effects disease progression and response to treatmentThis Review explores the role of sex biological constructs and gender social constructs as modifiers of the most common causes of

the importance of sex and gender as genetic wwwthelancetcom Vol August biological and environmental modifiers of chronic disease Ultimately it is a necessary and fundamental step towards precision medicine that will benefit women and menSex as a genetic modifier of biology and diseaseSex differences in disease prevalence manifestation and response to treatment are rooted in the genetic differences between men and women Genetic sex differences start at conception when the ovum fuses with a sperm cell carrying an X or a Y chromosome resulting in an embryo carrying either XX or XY chromosomes This fundamental difference in chromosome complement eg genes outside the testisdetermining SRY gene generates ubiquitous sex differences in the molecular makeup of all male and female cells9 First the Y chromosome carries genes that exhibit subtle functional differences from their Xlinked homologues eg ZFY vs ZFX and UTY vs UTX and also carries genes with no homologue at all eg SRY In addition in men the X chromosome carries only maternal imprints ie epigenetic modifications made by the parent in generating the sex cells which alter the expression of genes in the offspring As women have X chromosomes from both parents they carry maternal and paternal imprints which target a different set of genes Random inactivation of one of the X chromosomes in female cells which prevents sex differences in X chromosome gene dosage causes another degree of sex difference in gene expression As some of these Xlinked genes escape inactivation in women those genes are often expressed at higher levels in women than in men9 Sexspecific gene expression due to genomic Search strategy and selection criteriaWe searched PubMed for papers published in English between Jan and

and these imprinted genes exhibit sexspecific and tissuespecific expression in humans10 Thus fundamental sex differences deriving directly from genetic heterogeneity between the X and Y chromosome complements and parentoforigin inher itance exist at the molecular level in all human cells These sex differences persist throughout life and are independent of sex hormones figure Arguably the greatest source of differences between men and women comes from the Y chromosomal SRY gene which directs the development of a testis in men The ensuing developmental surge of testicular testosterone permanently masculinises the reproductive tract and the anisation of brain circuits affecting male behaviour at puberty1112 In humans the first surge occurs at the end of the first trimester of pregnancy Because it alters cellular gene expression and tissue structure in multiple ans of men via epigenetic mechanisms this testosterone surge is also paramount in programming sex differences in physiology and susceptibility to diseases that will manifest in adulthood After this initial testicular testosterone surge gonadal hormone concentrations remain low until puberty which triggers lasting sex differences in circulating oestrogens and testosterone concentrations After puberty cells with androgen or AFemale sexBRandom X chromosomeinactivation and escapeXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXY

inactivation in female individuals and have a higher expression in female than male individuals C The Y chromosomal SRY gene directs the development of a testis in male individuals which produces a surge of testicular testosterone at the end of pregnancy The testosterone surge programmes cellular gene expression and tissue structure in multiple ans of male individuals via epigenetic remodelling The combination of these genetic and developmental events programmes sex differences in physiology and susceptibility to diseases that will manifest in adulthoodoestrogen receptors will be affected differ ently in men and women The combination of all genetic and hormonal causes of sex differences aforementioned culminates in two different biological systems in men and women that translate into differences in disease predisposition manifestation and response to treatment Therefore sex is an important modifier of physiology and disease via genetic epigenetic and hormonal regulations figure Gender as a determinant of patients and doctors behaviour and as a modifier of health disease and medicineGender according to the Global Health definition refers to the socially constructed norms that impose and determine roles relationships and positional power for all people across their lifetime13 Gender interacts with sex the biological and physical characteristics that define women men and those with intersex identities13 Gender is not a binary term It includes the understanding that in many people traits of masculinity or femininity coexist and are expressed to different degrees Gender attributes are fluid more than two thirds of women and men report genderrelated characteristics traditionally attributed to the opposite sex1415 In transgender people gender identity differs with the sex they were assigned at birth So far transgender people have generally been underrepresented in clinical studies to date although this underrepresentation is changing Gender is an equally important variable as biological sex in human health and influences the behaviour of communities clinicians and patients1415 Gender roles represent the behavioural norms applied to men and women in society which influence individuals everyday actions expectations and experiences including diet perceived stress smoking and physical activity and affect health and disease susceptibility Gender identity describes the fluidity of how a person perceives oneself as a woman or a man which affects feelings and behaviours Gender relations refer to how we interact with or are treated by people on the basis of our ascribed gender Institutionalised gender reflects the distribution of power between men and women in the political educational and social institutions in society and shapes social norms that define perpetuate and often justify different expectations and opportunities for women and men1617 As such the distribution of genderrelated charac teristics within populations of men and women can influence health differently than biological sex Together these gender constructs determine access to health care helpseeking behaviours and individual use of the healthcare system Being perceived as a man or a woman triggers different responses from clinicians who might diagnose and suggest interventions differently according to gender As such gender largely determines the use of preventive measures and referral for or acceptance of invasive therapeutic strategies Genderrelated behaviours contribute to risk exposure and preventive behaviour in several wwwthelancetcom Vol August Review 0cdiseases This postulation is well exemplified in the cardiovascular field in which women often underestimate their risk compared with men and seek consultation later than men in the clinic for treatment of myocardial infarction1819 In the GENESISPRAXY prospective study mortality year after an acute coronary event was more strongly associated with gender than with biological sex1415 Similarly control of cardio vascular risk factors hypertension diabetes depres sive symptoms was better predicted by gender than by biological sex1415 Therefore including a gender dimension in clinical studies and practice will contribute to the understanding of different clinical manifestations and outcomes of diseases in women and men1617 Although beyond the scope of this Review it is also important to consider that regarding health and disease gender intersect with race or ethnicity and age20 Sex and gender are fundamentally and frequently reciprocally interrelated in biology and disease24 Sex influences behaviours eg towards more aggressive or caring phenotypes On the other hand genderrelated behaviours eg smoking lifestyle perceived stress and pain and nutritional habits might produce epigenetic modifications that modulate gene expression and biological phenotypes Figure summarises how sex and gender are interrelated in biology and diseaseSex and gender differences in major chronic diseasesHaving established the importance of sex and gender in disease we will summarise their influences on the most common causes of death and debilitating diseases in the USA as an example figure Note that these sex and gender disparities are relevant to other highincome countries as well as lowincome and middleincome countries where the burden of these diseases becomes increasingly like those in highincome countries26 In most diseases efforts to separate the effects of sex and gender are still incomplete so that we just refer to the differences among women and men Because current knowledge about pathophysiology diagnosis and treatment of disease is primarily based on men as representative of the human species this Review focuses on how women differ from men We discuss some key aspects regarding the dimensions of men in a dedicated sectionHeart diseaseEpidemiology pathogenesis manifestations and diagnosisHeart disease is the leading cause of death in the USA In heart disease accounted for of all deaths for men and for of all deaths for women figure Ischaemic heart disease and heart failure are major contributors to heart disease mortality and have important sex and gender differences For example heart failure disproportionately contributes to coronary heart disease mortality in women27 potentially due to undiagnosed ischaemic heart disease in

other hand genderrelated behaviours eg smoking lifestyle perceived stress and nutritional habits produce epigenetic modifications that modulate the expression of biological sex Gender constructs determine patients perception of disease helpseeking behaviour and individual use of health care Gender constructs also influence decision making and trigger different therapeutic responses from providers biased by genderSystolic blood pressure and hypertension smoking and diabetes are associated with higher hazard ratios for myocardial infarction in women than in men28Ischaemic heart disease is the most recognised example for integrating the concept of gender and sex which shape divergent or distinct disease outcomes Compared with men women suffering from ischaemic heart disease are older this difference is historically believed to be due to the protection of endogenous oestrogens29 although contemporary study refutes this simplistic explanation30 and associations cannot be inferred to be causation Still women suffering from ischaemic heart disease are underdiagnosed3132 and less likely to have a prehospital diagnosis of myocardial infarction33 The reasons for this disparity reflect the intersection between sex and gender First biological sex differences exist in the pathogenesis of ischaemic heart disease Whereas men are more likely to be affected by obstructive coronary artery disease of large vessels than women coronary microvascular dysfunction36 leading to chronic myocardial ischaemia without obstructive coronary artery disease has a higher prevalence in women than men37 A metaanalysis reported that following acute myocardial infarction both sexes most often presented with chest pain but compared with men women were more likely to present with pain between the shoulder blades nausea or vomiting and shortness of breathProf J G Regensteiner PhD Department of Medicine Department of Paediatrics and Department of Neuroscience Washington University School of

Cancer Figure Percent distribution of the ten leading causes of death by sex USA Adapted from Heron25 CPDchronic pulmonary diseaseSecond a gender bias appears to be responsible for the absence of recognition of ischaemic heart disease presentation in women38 Men and women with ischaemic heart disease who score high on feminine roles and personality traits on questionnaires designed to ascertain aspects of gender are at an increased risk of recurrent ischaemic heart disease independent of female sex39Heart failure affects of adults aged years and older and more women than men in absolute numbers4041 Heart failure occurs at an older age and with less ischaemic causes in women than in men However hypertension and diabetes predispose older women to heart failure to a greater extent than men Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction a form of heart failure with normal systolic function is twice as prevalent in women as in men By contrast heart failure with reduced ejection fraction affects more men than women Women who have heart failure with preserved ejection fraction have smaller and stiffer hearts than men Inflammation and the resulting fibrosis play a sexspecific role in the pathogenesis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction Under stress premenopausal women s hearts develop less inflammation resulting in less fibrosis than men s hearts4243 This difference is partially driven by sex hormones as oestrogens produce antiinflammatory actions on endothelial and immune cells and promote cardioprotective effects in premenopausal women44 This Response to treatmentCompared with men women suffering from ischaemic heart disease are less likely to receive evidencebased treatment3132 and when suffering from acute myocardial infarction they are less likely to receive reperfusion33 An STelevation myocardial infarction registry revealed that compared with men women exhibit delayed reperfusion leading to higher mortality46 Women suffering from acute myocardial infarction treated by male emergency physicians have a higher mortality rate than those treated by female physicians38 Additionally male physicians are more effective at treating female patients with acute myocardial infarction when they work with female colleagues and when they have experience in treating female patients38 This treatment disparity between women and men can be corrected by improving emergency recognition of STelevation myocardial infarction in women and acceleration of percutaneous coronary intervention which equilibrates gender mortality47Guidelines for the treatment of heart failure are similar for women and men24 However evidence suggests that optimal survival in women occurs with lower doses of Î² blockers angiotensin receptor blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors than in men48 Finally fewer women undergo heart transplantation than men although women are more frequently donors suggesting a referral bias could exist41CancersEpidemiology pathogenesis manifestations and diagnosisCancers are the second leading cause of death dominated by lung cancer accounting for of deaths in men and of deaths in women figure More men develop cancer than women49 With few exceptions eg meningioma thyroid cancer lung cancer in nonsmokers nonreproductive cancers exhibit a male predominance though for some cancers oropharynx larynx oesophagus and bladder the male versus female incidence ratios can be higher than A male predominance in cancers that affect both sexes is evident around the world in all races and at all ages50 Survival is also shorter for men than women across multiple cancer types The higher cancer risk in men is partially explained by gender constructs like dietary habits or risk behaviours such as smoking and alcohol consump tion51 It is unlikely to be the only cause After appropriate adjustment for these risk factors adult men still have a higher cancer risk than women52 Moreover a similar male bias in incidence and survival is seen in paediatric cancers before puberty and the adoption of highrisk cancerpromoting behaviours eg smoking53The universal male predominance in cancer incidence and differential outcomes argues for a fundamental role wwwthelancetcom Vol August Review 0cin inutero tumour suppressors of sex in addition to gender in cancer biology Sexspecific biology includes genetic differences XX vs XY chromosomes the incomplete Xinactivation in female individuals which results in biallelic expression of Xencoded female cells54 Y chromosomeencoded oncogenes such as the RNAbinding motif on Y chromosome in male cells55 and the chromatin remodelling effects of testicular testosterone in male cells56 These mechanisms have an influence on several of the hallmarks of cancer57 including metabolism growth regulation58 angiogenesis and immunity which all contribute to cancer predisposition59 A crucial example is the male predisposition to glioblastoma which is the most common form of brain cancer In glioblastoma there is a cellintrinsic predisposition of male astrocytes a subtype of glial cell to malignant transformation60 After puberty sex hormones produce additional epigenetic and acute effects on cells that further influence sex disparities in cancer For example the increased frequency and aggressive phenotype of hepatocellular carcinoma in male individuals has been linked to the stimulatory effects of androgens in male individuals and the protective effects of oestrogens in female individuals61 Importantly the biology of cancer is not the same across histological and genetic diagnostic groups or even within single histol ogical subtypes Thus the interaction between sex gender and cancer mechanisms cannot be expected to be constant Take colon cancer the second leading cause of cancerrelated death for example Although women have a lower overall incidence of colon cancer than men they have a higher incidence of rightsided colon cancers which have the worst outcomes62 Tumours from women with rightsided colon cancers exhibit a distinct molecular signature of energy metabolism compared with those of women with leftsided colon cancers63 This molecular signature is not observed when comparing tumours from men with rightsided colon cancers to men with leftsided colon cancers Thus overall the male predisposition to cancer is probably the consequence of genetic program ming of male cells and the effect of sex hormones after puberty interacting with genderspecific behaviours to establish cancer risksResponse to treatmentIn the future cancer prevention and treatment will be improved by sexspecific and genderspecific approaches For example immune checkpoint inhibitors can improve survival for men with advanced melanomas and nonsmallcell lung cancers more than for women64 The molecular subtyping of glioblastomas based on sexspecific transcriptomes has the potential to enhance chemotherapy in a sexspecific manner65 In colon cancer sex differences in xenobiotic metabolism regulatory networks might underlie greater treatment response in women than men and require modification of approaches for men with colon cancer66 Other elements of cancer metabolism are also ripe for novel sexspecific targeting in treatment Cellular nutrient partitioning is sexually dimorphic so approaches such as ketogenic diets or glutaminase inhibition might be associated with substantial sexspecific responses67 Furthermore data from models of development ageing and cancer all indicate that molecular pathways such as the enzyme phosphatidylinositol 3kinase and tumour suppressors such as p53 and retinoblastoma protein are sexually dimorphic and require sexspecific targeting545968Chronic pulmonary diseaseEpidemiology pathogenesis manifestations and diagnosisChronic pulmonary disease is the third leading cause of death for women of deaths and the fourth for men figure It is mostly accounted for by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and to a lesser extent by asthma Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is characterised by irreversible airflow limitation and is associated with previous exposure to smoking or air pollutants Women are overrepresented among individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease especially among those with earlyonset disease or those who have never smoked69 Women are also twice as likely to have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with chronic bronchitis and women with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease have as much emphysema as men countering the misconception of emphysema as a male form of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease70 The female lung is more susceptible to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease than the male lung and women develop symptoms of the disease at a younger age with less tobacco exposure than men71 The Genetic Epidemiology of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease COPDGene study72 suggests that earlyonset chronic obstructive pulmonary disease might originate in utero in susceptible women from alterations in lung development potentiated by maternal asthma and smoking genetic factors or hormonal influences Future studies should focus on the contribution of maternally inherited factors such as mitochondrial and X chromosome genes to understand disease pathogenesis It is important to consider gender constructs as well Smoking advertising campaigns targeting women rose in the 1960s and the resulting higher smoking rates influenced women s risk for developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease73 From a disease severity vantage point chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation rates are also higher in women than men especially at a younger age74 Additionally despite the burden of symptomatology and increased rates of hospitalisations and deaths women with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are often misdiagnosed and disproportionally suffer from comorbid conditions including anxiety and depression Therefore physicians should consider chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the differential diagnosis of women with pulmonary symptoms regardless of tobacco or pollutant exposure historieswwwthelancetcom Vol August Review 0cAsthma characterised by variable airflow obstruction and chronic airway inflammation also affects men and women differently Asthma is more prevalent in prepubertal boys than girls Regarding asthma both male biological sex lung development and atopy and male gender constructs related to outdoor play and indoor pet exposure are factors contributing to the devel opment of asthma and sex versus gender contributions could be difficult to separate75 F",
