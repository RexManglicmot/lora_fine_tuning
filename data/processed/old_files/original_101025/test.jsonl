These results indicate that Sp1 negatively regulates FOXO3 expression. Sp1 negatively regulates FOXO3 expression through regulating miR-182 (A) The Sp1 and FOXO3 levels in clinical lung tissue samples were studied by IHC staining using antibodies against Sp1 and FOXO3 respectively. (B) Cell lysates were harvested from various cell lines for Western blotting using antibodies against FOXO3 and Sp1 and tubulin as an internal control. (C) Adeno-GFP-Sp1 viruses were infected into IMR-90 cells for 48 h and FOXO3 mRNA and protein were studied by RT-PCR and Western blotting respectively. GAPDH served as the internal control (panel a). Scramble and Sp1 shRNAs were transfected into H1299 for 48 h then FOXO3 mRNA and protein levels were studied by RT-PCR and Western blotting (panel b). (D) Scramble and Sp1 shRNAs were transfected into H1299 for 48 h and then cells were harvested at indicated time points following cycloheximide treatment for studying the Sp1 and FOXO3 levels with Western blotting. The levels of FOXO3 protein from three independent experiments were quantified using tubulin as an internal control. (E) Plasmids pGL2 or pGL2-FOXO3 (-1000 50) were cotransfected with GFP or GFP-Sp1 into H1299 cells for 24 h then cell lysates were harvested for luciferase activity assays. (F) Adeno-GFP-Sp1 viruses were infected into H1299 cells for 24 h and cells were then transfected with pGL3 or pGL3-FOXO3-3'UTR plasmid for 24 h. Cells lysates were harvested for luciferase activity assays. (G) H1299 cells which were infected with GFP-Sp1 adenovirus for 24 h were then transfected with pGL3 or pGL3-FOXO3-3'UTR plasmid for 24 h. Total RNA was extracted at various time points following actinomycin D treatment. The mRNA levels of luciferase were determined by using quantitative RT-PCR and quantified using GAPDH as an internal control. Data are representative of three independent experiments each of which was performed in triplicate and presented as the mean SEM. The level of statistical significance determined by t-test ( p 0.05; p 0.01). Next we investigated the mechanism by which Sp1 regulates FOXO3 expression. FOXO3 protein half-life was studied after Sp1 knockdown. Knockdown of Sp1 expression did not affect FOXO3 protein stability (D). We then constructed a luciferase reporter construct containing the FOXO3 promoter (-1000 50) to study the effect of Sp1 on the promoter-mediated transcription of FOXO3 (E). GFP-Sp1 overexpression significantly enhanced the luciferase activity indicating that Sp1 positively regulated FOXO3 transcription (E). However FOXO3 mRNA and protein levels decreased as shown in C. The data shown in indicated that Sp1 increased miR-182 expression which suggests that post-transcriptional processing contributes to the regulation of FOXO3 expression. Thus the 3'-UTR of FOXO3 might play an important role in stabilizing FOXO3 mRNA and in FOXO3 translation. Consequently a luciferase reporter construct containing the 3?-UTR of FOXO3 was generated. GFP-Sp1 overexpression reduced the luciferase activity (F). Furthermore the stability of the luciferase mRNA containing the 3?-UTR sequence of FOXO3 decreased dramatically upon GFP-Sp1 overexpression (G). These results indicate that Sp1 regulates FOXO3 expression through transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation with a net negative effect on FOXO3 expression. miR-182 inhibits lung cancer metastasis activity The data shown in indicated that miR-182 positively regulated lung cancer cell growth. Therefore the role of miR-182 in lung cancer metastasis was studied (). The morphology of miRZip-182 cells was markedly altered: circular structures of actin filaments were absence and pseudopodia were enriched suggesting that miR-182 decreased the cells' migratory ability (A). Indeed knockdown of miR-182 expression increased the migration ability of lung cancer cells suggesting that miR-182 inhibits lung cancer migration (B). Moreover transwell migration assays showed that knockdown of miR-182 expression enhanced cell's invasive capacity (C). In mice injected with miRZip-182-treated cells the knockdown of miR-182 expression also increased the number of nodules in the lung suggesting that miR-182 represses metastatic ability in vivo (D). The effects of miR-182 knockdown were partially reversed by knockdown of FOXO3 suggesting that miR-182 functions as a suppressor of lung cancer metastasis by repressing FOXO3 expression (E panel a). The endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) marker N-cadherin increased after miR-182 knockdown but this effect was abolished by FOXO3 knockdown. Thus miR-182 might repress lung cancer metastasis by decreasing the expression of N-cadherin (E panel b). However the expression of other genes regulated by miR-182 might also play a role in metastasis (F and Supplementary Figure S3). Therefore we generated gene expression profiles using microarray analysis. Functional grouping analysis using DAVID bioinformatics resources showed that 19 of the genes differentially regulated by miR-182 knockdown were related to cell migration. The expression of these genes was increased in miR-182-knockdown cells indicating that they are potential targets of miR-182 (F). Many metastasis-related genes such as CD44 CDH9 and ADAM9 were upregulated after the knockdown of miR-182 expression (F). miR-182 attenuates lung cancer cell metastasis (A) Immunofluorescent staining of Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated phalloidin that is a high-affinity probe for F-actin (red) in miRZip and miRZip-182 stably expressed H1299 cells. DNA was stained with DAPI (blue). Stained cells were photographed under a fluorescence microscope at x 600 magnification. (B) Confluent monolayers of miRZip or miRZip-182 stably expressed H1299 cells were wounded and incubated for an additional 16 h (panel a). Migratory area was calculated for quantification (panel b). (C) The migration activities of H1299 cells (2 x 104) expressing miRZip or miRZip-182 were studied by Transwell chambers. (D) The miRZip or miRZip-182 stably expressed H1299 cells (4 x 106) were suspended in 100 ?l of PBS and injected into the lateral tail vein of SCID mice. After 8 weeks all mice were killed and the number of pulmonary tumor nodules was calculated after fixation of lungs with 4 formaldehyde for 48 h (panel a) and the number of pulmonary metastatic tumor nodules was counted (panel b). (E) FOXO3 and miR-182 in H1299 cells were knockdown by shFOXO3 and miRZip-182 respectively and then migration of cells (3 x 104) was studies by Transwell chambers (panel a). In addition cell lysates were harvested from FOXO3 and miR-182 knockdown cells for Western blotting using antibodies against N-cadherin ?-catenin vimentin FOXO3 and tubulin (panel b) respectively. (F) Heat map of the 19 of genes from miRZip and miRZip-182 microarray data the red color represents genes that are upregulated and the green color represents genes that are downregulated. The level of statistical significance determined by t-test ( p 0.05; p 0.01; p 0.001). DISCUSSION Our recent studies showed that Sp1 increased the growth of lung cancer cells but inhibits metastatic activity 23 32 . In the present study we found that Sp1 which accumulated in the early stages of cancer positively regulated miR-182 gene expression to silence FOXO3 expression and thereby promote cancer cell growth. In addition decreased levels of Sp1 in the late stages of cancer increased the expression of FOXO3 and N-cadherin leading to cancer metastasis (). (A) Clinical samples from lung cancer patients of stage I and IV were used to study the Sp1 level by IHC staining with anti-Sp1 antibodies (B) Schematic diagram illustrates Sp1 regulates miR-182 to silence FOXO3 expression in early and late stages of lung cancer progression. Sp1 functions as a transcriptional activator by recruiting p300 to its target genes and as a repressor by the recruiting HDACs. Because Sp1 accumulates in several types of cancer including lung cancer 33 understanding the Sp1 transcriptional regulatory network may provide novel insights into the molecular origins and treatment of lung cancer. In our previous studies of lung cancer we found that Sp1 was highly upregulated in the early stages of cancer progression but partially down regulated in the late stages. Our previous studies also showed that regulation of Sp1 protein stability by phosphorylation and sumoylation contributed to its expression in the early and late stages of cancer respectively 32 . Kras activation and the Notch pathway might activate ERK1 2 to phosphorylate Sp1 thus stabilizing Sp1 in the early stages of cancer 32 34 . In the late stages Sp1 could be sumoylated leading to recruitment of its E3-ligase RNF4 followed by polyubiquitination and degradation 32 . To clarify the molecular mechanism underlying gene regulation by Sp1 we used microarray analysis to assess gene expression in KrasG12D-induced lung tumor transgenic mice and identified thousands of genes potentially regulated by Sp1 23 . However some of the genes do not harbor a conserved Sp1 binding motif within their promoter region suggesting that another regulatory mechanism is involved in Sp1-mediated gene regulation.\nLabels: [Thyroid_Cancer, Colon_Cancer, Lung_Cancer]\nReply with one label only.", "assistant": "Lung_Cancer"}

significant progress on elucidating the functionof key proteins involved in reproduction understanding male reproductive physiology is limited by incompleteinformation on the genes expressed in reproductive tissues and no contraceptive targets have so far reachedclinical trials to advance product development further identification of novel reproductive tractspecific genesleading to potentially druggable protein targets is imperativeresults in this study we expand on previous single tissue single species studies by integrating analysis of publiclyavailable human and mouse rnaseq datasets whose initial published purpose was not focused on identifyingmale reproductive tractspecific targets we also incorporate analysis of additional newly acquired human andmouse testis and epididymis samples to increase the number of targets identified we detected a combined totalof genes for which no previous evidence of male reproductive tractspecific expression was annotated manyof which are potentially druggable targets through rtpcr we confirmed the reproductive tractspecific expressionof novel orthologous human and mouse genes without a reported mouse model of these we ablated fourepididymisspecific genes spint3 spint4 spint5 and ces5a and two testisspecific genes pp2d1 and saxo1 inindividual or double knockout mice generated through the crisprcas9 system our results validate a functionalrequirement for spint45 and ces5a in male mouse fertility while demonstrating that spint3 pp2d1 and saxo1 areeach individually dispensable for male mouse fertilitys our

widelyrecognized currently there are numerous contraceptiveoptions available to women however identification of asafe nonhormonal contraceptive option for men is stillan ongoing challenge although several different fertilitycontrol alternatives for men have been investigatednone are currently clinically approved for use our understanding of the mechanisms underlying male reproductive physiology is still at an early stage as theidentification and elucidation of the function of key reproductive proteins is still an ongoing effort identifyingdruggable protein targets expressed in the male reproductive tract has been the focus of numerous studiesdedicated to the development of male contraceptionessentialroletheitsthe mammalian epididymis is a segmented ancomprised of a single highly coiled tubule with functionally and morphologically distinct regions that can besubdivided most simplistically into a proximal centraland distal region conventionally named the caput corpus and cauda regions respectively as mammalianspermatozoa transit through the epididymis they acquire the ability to recognize and fertilize an egg properties that they did not possess upon exiting the testis epididymis inconsideringaddition to maturing germ cells of the testis and spermatozoa is a prime target for the development of a malecontraceptive to advance progress towards the development of a nonhormonal male contraceptive several previous highthroughput studies have been published thatidentified a number of human mouse and rat genes astestisspecific or epididymisspecific in schultz conducted the first study to identify malereproductive tractspecific genes using microarraysthroughgeneexpression analysis of meiotic and postmeiotic spermatogenic cells together with parallel analysis of available data from the ncbi unigene database the authorsidentified mouse genes as testisspecific which included genes with both known and unknown function atthe time in the following years through two additional microarraybased studies of rat testes and purifiedrat testicular cells johnston identified and additional or overlapping genes astestisspecific in as part of the continued effort to identify novel contraceptive targets the newer rnaseqbased transcriptomics methodology was utilized identifying human genes as testisspecific together withantibodybased protein profiling many of these genesaffymetrixbasedgenomewidewere characterized in terms of the spermatogenic cellpopulations showing expression the first highthroughput transcriptomics study to identify epididymisspecific genes was a mouse epididymal transcriptome studyin which rna isolated fromeach of the epididymal segments was analyzed bymicroarray analysisidentifying epididymisspecificgenes with distinct patterns of segmental gene regulation later in additional transcriptome profiling utilizing whole genome microarrays resulted in identification of previously unreported epididymisspecific transcripts inthe mouse and epididymisspecific transcripts inthe rat a significant number of the identified mouseand rat genes in these studies were not known at the timeand only the probe identification numbers were presentedwhen evaluating potential druggability in a targetbased drug discovery process one must consider theprotein properties that are required for safe and effectiveinhibition among the most significant is tissue expression specificity to minimize potential adverse effectsprotein function and whether protein activity or interaction with other proteins is potentially druggable sequence similarity to closely related paralogs that may beubiquitously expressed and whether genetically manipulated animal models demonstrate a functional requirement for the target of interest several noteworthyreview publications have mentioned numerous geneswhose critical functions high expression and specificityto the testes or epididymides make them viable nonhormonal male contraceptive targets howeveramong the identified genes a significant number either are required for fertility but are expressed in nonreproductive tissues or are reproductive tractspecific but when disrupted lead to subfertility ineither case both are ineffective and highly undesirableoutcomes for a potential male contraceptive targettherefore the identification of additional novel male reproductive tractspecific genes would allow for furtheradvances to be made in the quest to develop an effectiveand safe nonhormonal male contraceptivein this study newly acquired and previously published human and mouse rnaseq datasets were processed in parallel through a custom bioinformatics pipeline designed to identify novel reproductive tractspecific and reproductive tractenriched

Finally the involvement of senior managers was crucial to the successful implementation of the quality improvement plans. The detailed findings from the independent evaluation of this project have been reported elsewhere (Aveling et al 2012). Discussion Lung cancer outcomes remain relatively poor and reducing unexplained variation is an attractive proposition to promote improvement. There are a number of ways that clinical teams may share best practice and innovative service delivery models however studies formally evaluating their impact are limited. To our knowledge this is the first study to formally test a national quality improvement strategy which aimed to bring the standard of all lung cancer teams to that of the best. We have demonstrated that reciprocal peer-to-peer review with supported quality improvement is both feasible and effective at stimulating local quality improvement activity but had a relatively modest and somewhat disappointing impact on process and outcome measures as measured by NLCA indicators and a new lung cancer patient experience questionnaire. The facilitated reciprocal visits represented a new and unique opportunity for all members of a lung cancer team to exchange ideas in a supported environment and to formally design then implement quality improvement plans. Nearly two-thirds of lung cancer multidisciplinary teams in England agreed to take part in the study and reassuringly baseline NLCA indicators did not differ significantly between participants and non-participants suggesting that the willingness to participate in quality improvement activity is not related to baseline performance. There were a wide range of areas identified for improvement but nearly half of the teams identified multidisciplinary team meeting effectiveness as a key issue. This is not surprising given that these meetings are pivotal in the lung cancer pathway. Live observation of each multidisciplinary team meeting followed by facilitated feedback proved to be a strong driver to improve on problems such as ensuring weekly presence of all the treatment specialists as well as more simple issues such as room layout. The need to streamline diagnostic and treatment pathways was also identified as a common problem. Recent NICE guidance on the management of lung cancer (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 2011) recommended a paradigm shift in the diagnostic algorithm from performing multiple diagnostic and staging investigations to performing a single test that will provide both diagnostic and staging information. A number of teams within our study were able to introduce such pathways and demonstrate impressive reductions in diagnostic times and more prompt treatment. This together with more effective multidisciplinary team working may have led to the small increase in the active anti-cancer treatment rates seen within the intervention group. However an alternative explanation for the improvement is regression to the mean given that treatment rates in the intervention group were lower at baseline and overall the lack of significant improvement across the range of NLCA indicators in the intervention group was disappointing. One possible explanation for this is the challenge that some participating teams encountered converting enthusiastic quality improvement plans into tangible improvements for patients over a relatively short time period. The qualitative evaluation confirmed that participants often underestimated the time and energy required to implement and sustain change and highlighted the importance of early engagement with hospital managers to maintain momentum (Aveling et al 2012). Alternatively other national lung cancer initiatives implemented at the time of the study may have driven coexistent improvements in the control group. For example the drive to encourage all lung cancer patients to be referred for clinical nurse specialist support has subsequently been shown to increase the probability that a lung cancer patient receives active treatment. Although even small improvements in lung cancer treatment rates are very welcome it is recognised that undergoing investigation for suspected lung cancer generates high levels of patient anxiety and many patients will remain too unwell to benefit from currently available drugs. The assessment of patient experience is therefore of particular importance in lung cancer. This has proved challenging in detailed national cancer surveys owing to the advance in age poor health and short median survival of lung cancer patients. The response rate to our short questionnaire was relatively high at 41 49 compared with the 2011 national survey in which only 7 of lung cancer patients responded (Department of Health 2012) but still represents the views of less than half of lung cancer patients and is a relative limitation in terms of generalisability of the results. It was reassuring to note that at entry to the study patients in the intervention group generally rated their experience as highly satisfactory. This may explain the low number of teams who specifically identified patient experience as an area for quality improvement. In terms of assessing the impact of the reciprocal peer-to-peer review visits and supported quality improvement on patient experience it is likely that this high-baseline satisfaction and the lack of patient experience data for the control group limited our ability to detect a significant change. However our results suggest that those teams with poor scores may be able to use patient experience data to promote significant improvements particularly in areas such as communication skills. Further work is required to develop a lung cancer patient experience measure that is both acceptable to patients and able to detect small but clinically important changes in experience. Although similar in name to the national cancer peer review process there are a number of important differences between the reciprocal peer-to-peer review and supported quality improvement process employed in the current study and national cancer peer review. The latter predominantly performs a quality assurance role ensuring that cancer teams meet a minimum standard via compliance with a number of process measures. Support with quality improvement is not provided and site visits are now rarely performed. The qualitative evaluation of our study highlighted the importance of an independent quality improvement facilitator to the success of the peer review visits and the subsequent implementation of the quality improvement plans. Integration of facilitated reciprocal peer-to-peer review and supported quality improvement into national cancer peer review both for lung cancer and other tumour sites is an attractive proposition and requires further study. However our results suggest that this strategy alone is unlikely to have a major impact on lung cancer treatment rates. This phenomenon is not new in lung cancer for example the introduction and NICE approval of gefitinib treatment for the first-line treatment of lung cancer in 2010 was associated with only a 1 increase in active anti-cancer treatment rates over the following year (Health and Social Care Information Centre 2012). Achieving a stepwise increase in lung cancer treatment rates and survival is likely to require a multi-targeted approach including earlier diagnosis streamlined lung cancer pathways new treatments and a reduction in unexplained variation via supported quality improvement programmes.

Background Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide and characterized by a poor prognosis. It has a major impact on the psychological wellbeing of patients and their partners. Recently it has been shown that Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is effective in reducing anxiety and depressive symptoms in cancer patients. The generalization of these results is limited since most participants were female patients with breast cancer. Moreover only one study examined the effectiveness of MBSR in partners of cancer patients. Therefore in the present trial we study the effectiveness of MBSR versus treatment as usual (TAU) in patients with lung cancer and their partners. Methods Design A parallel group randomized controlled trial is conducted to compare MBSR with TAU. Lung cancer patients who have received or are still under treatment and their partners are recruited. Assessments will take place at baseline post intervention and at three-month follow-up. The primary outcome is psychological distress (i.e. anxiety and depressive symptoms). Secondary outcomes are quality of life (only for patients) caregiver appraisal (only for partners) relationship quality and spirituality. In addition cost-effectiveness ratio (only in patients) and several process variables are assessed. Discussion This trial will provide information about the clinical and cost-effectiveness of MBSR compared to TAU in patients with lung cancer and their partners. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01494883. Mindfulness-based stress reduction Lung cancer patients Partners Psychological distress Randomized controlled trial Background With an estimated 1.4 million deaths per year lung cancer is the leading cause of death by cancer worldwide. Even with the best available treatment five-year survival is merely 16 and about 60 to 70 of patients die within the first year after diagnosis 1 . This poor prognosis is often caused by a late diagnosis as the presentation usually occurs when the lung cancer is advanced. Patients may develop burdensome symptoms like pain dyspnoea fatigue and cough and they may undergo radical treatment including surgery chemo- and radiotherapy. Not surprisingly lung cancer has a major impact on the psychological wellbeing of patients and their family. Akechi and colleagues 2 showed that 19 of patients with advanced lung cancer meets the criteria of psychiatric disorders especially depressive and adjustment disorders. Of patients who had been successfully treated for lung cancer 15 met the criteria for a minor or major depressive disorder 3 . The prevalence rate of depressive and anxiety symptoms among lung cancer patients ranges from 20 to 47 4-7 . Compared to patients with other cancer diagnoses lung cancer patients report the highest rates of distress (43 to 58 ) 89 resulting in a lower quality of life 10 . Family friends and especially partners of patients with lung cancer also have to deal with its psychological impact 11-14 . Partners not only provide emotional and practical support they also have to cope with their own concerns including the uncertainty regarding the course of the illness and the fear of losing their partner 15 . More than 50 of partners of lung cancer patients report negative emotional effects of caregiving 16 . Around 40 of partners of patients with advanced lung cancer report high levels of distress 17 . The relationship between patient and partner can also be affected by the cancer. It has been shown that some partners report a lower quality of their relationship after the diagnosis of lung cancer 18 . Though numerous studies examined the psychological distress of lung cancer patients and their partners 2-22 not much research is done on how to alleviate distress in these groups 23 . In addition the available studies on managing the psychosocial care needs of cancer patients and their families have focused on care at the very end of life (e.g. 24-26 ). Recently studies have demonstrated that palliative care initiated early in treatment improves the quality of life and depressive symptoms of lung cancer patients 1027 . This stresses the importance of integrating psychosocial care for lung cancer patients and their partners early in the treatment rather than instigating it once life-prolonging therapies fail. In the past ten years MBSR has become a promising psychosocial intervention for cancer patients. Mindfulness is defined as intentionally paying attention to moment-by-moment experiences in a non-judgmental way 28 . MBSR is an 8-week group-based training consisting of meditation practices such as the bodyscan gentle yoga sitting and walking meditation. By repeatedly bringing attention back to the current experience participants gradually learn to disengage from dysfunctional thoughts and directly experience the emotions and bodily sensations of the present moment. MBSR aims to provide participants with the ability to step back from ruminating about the past or worrying about the future and simply allow experiences to unfold 2829 . A recent meta-analysis 30 of 13 nonrandomized studies and 9 randomized controlled trials (RCT) concluded there is positive evidence for the use of mindfulness-based interventions in reducing psychological distress in cancer patients. Among the RCT s a reduction in symptom severity was found for both anxiety and depression corresponding to moderate pooled controlled effect sizes (Hedges s g 0.37 and Hedges s g 0.44 respectively) 30 . Though mindfulness-based interventions seem to be effective the authors note that across studies the majority of participants were women (85 ) and diagnosed with breast cancer (77 ). Compared to breast cancer patients patients with lung cancer are more often male older and have a poorer prognosis. Furthermore of these 22 studies only one study included the partners of the patients showing that partners also benefit from the MBSR training 31 . This is quite surprising since partners of cancer patients also report high levels of distress 32 . Aims The aim of the Mindfulness for Lung Oncology Nijmegen (MILON) study is to examine the effectiveness of MBSR compared to TAU in reducing psychological distress in patients with lung cancer and their partners. We hypothesize that patients in the MBSR group will report a lower level of psychological distress (i.e. anxiety and depressive symptoms) higher levels of quality of life quality of relationship and spirituality than those in the TAU group. Medical and societal costs will be lower in the MBSR versus TAU group. We expect partners in the MBSR group to report a lower level of psychological distress and higher levels of caregiver appraisal relationship quality and spirituality than their counterparts in the TAU group. With regard to the working mechanisms of the MBSR programme we will examine changes in mindfulness skills self-compassion rumination intrusion avoidance and adherence to MBSR. Methods Design Study design The design of the MILON study is a parallel group randomized controlled trial with an embedded process study. Participants are randomized between MBSR and TAU. The study protocol has been approved by our ethical review board (CMO Arnhem-Nijmegen) and registered under number 2011 519. Participants and procedure Patients and partners are recruited at the outpatient clinic of the Department of Pulmonary Diseases Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre (RUNMC) by a nurse practitioner and the attending physician. Patients and partners are invited to participate together but both are welcome to participate on their own if they do not have a partner or their partner is not willing to participate. Patients and or partners who are interested are provided with an information leaflet. If they are willing to participate they are invited for a research interview in which in- and exclusion criteria are assessed and informed consent is taken. At other participating hospitals (Department of Pulmonary Diseases Canisius-Wilhelmina Hospital Nijmegen; Department of Pulmonary Medicine Rijnstate Arnhem; Department of Oncology Elkerliek Hospital Helmond; Department of Pulmonary Medicine Jeroen Bosch Hospital; Department of Pulmonary Diseases Maas hospital Pantein Boxmeer) patients and their partners will be sent a letter with the invitation to participate in the study. One week later the researcher calls the patients to answer possible questions and asks whether the patient and partner are interested in participation. If so they are invited for a research interview at the RUNMC. Eligibility We include patients and or partners of patients who are (a) diagnosed with cytologically or histologically proven non-small cell lung cancer or small cell lung cancer and (b) have received or are still under treatment. Exclusion criteria for both patient and partner include: (a) being under 18 years of age (b) not being able to understand or use the Dutch language (c) former participation in MBSR or Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) (d) current and regular treatment by psychologist or psychiatrist (e) current participation in other psychosocial programme and (f) physical or cognitive ( 26 on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)) impairments hampering participation in MBSR training or completion of questionnaires. Baseline Patients and partners are interviewed to obtain demographics and clinical characteristics after which they are screened for cognitive impairments with the MMSE 33 . After that baseline questionnaires including the Distress Thermometer (DT) 3435 are administered followed by randomization. Table 1 shows the assessment instruments and time points at which the questionnaires are administered to patients and partners.

Randomization is computerized using a randomization website specifically designed for this study on which the researcher can fill out the required data. The researcher communicates treatment allocation to the nurse practitioner who informs the patient and or partner. Follow-up assessments Follow-up assessments take place post intervention and at three-month follow-up. Participants who have access to the internet and have an email address receive the questionnaires online. If not they receive the questionnaires on paper along with a reply envelope. In case of drop-out the researcher tries to contact the participant by phone to complete a minimum set of outcome measures and to identify the main reason for drop-out. Intervention The MBSR curriculum used is primarily based on the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction programme as developed by Kabat-Zinn 28 but contains some elements of the MBCT programme by Segal Williams and Teasdale 29 like psycho-education on the interrelatedness of feelings and thoughts. Moreover some modifications have been made to make the intervention more suitable for patients with lung cancer and their partners such as psycho-education about grief 36 . In addition a mindful communication exercise in which partners talk with each other about the cancer was added. The programme consists of 8 weekly 2.5-hour sessions a silent day between session six and seven and home practice assignments of about 45 minutes 6 days per week. Participants receive a set of CDs with guided mindfulness meditation exercises for home practice and a folder with information and home practice instructions for the forthcoming week. Table 2 shows the content of the MBSR programme per session. The MBSR courses are taught by mindfulness teachers with extensive training in MBSR. They all fulfil the advanced criteria of the Center for Mindfulness of the University of Massachusetts Medical School 37 and maintain a regular personal meditation practice. Teachers were trained supervised and assessed to ensure their competency levels met the qualification criteria to instruct the MBSR classes. During the trial teachers will receive weekly supervision and a number of sessions will be videotaped to evaluate competence and adherence with the Mindfulness-Based Interventions Teaching Assessment Criteria 38 .

upon integrating early palliative care into advanced cancer treatment icuadmission in the last days of life and late hospicereferral have been secularly increasing yet not allanizations are equal cancer centers vary by morethan twofold in these eol intensity measures these variations cannot be explained by structural characteristics or casemix since centers serving ahigher proportion of minority patients have systematically higher eol intensity than centers serving a higherproportion of white patients these variations inpractice patterns may contribute to racial disparities inburdensome treatment near death moreover despiteefforts to attribute such variation to differences in patient preferences rather regionlevel analyses suggest that the impact of thesepreferences on variation are likely very small than racial disparitiesin local anizational and providerwe posit that a critical barrier to improving thequality of eol cancer care in the us and amongminorities in particular is our lack of understandingregarding the mechanisms underlying cancer centervariation in eol treatment intensity the overarching hypothesis driving this study is that

{"system": "You are a medical text classifier. Choose exactly one label.", "user": "Text: However the production and administration of these tailor-made DC vaccines are costly and labor-intensive 5 . As a next-step in the development of DC vaccines we designed a recombinant protein that contains a Mycobacterium tuberculosis heat shock protein 70 (MTBHsp70) fused to a single chain variable fragment (scFv) derived from human B cells that targets mesothelin. Mesothelin (MSLN) is a validated immunotherapy target that is highly overexpressed on the surface of common epithelial cancers including ovarian cancers epithelial malignant mesotheliomas ductal pancreatic adenocarcinomas and lung adenocarcinomas while expressed at relatively low levels only in mesothelial cells lining the pleura pericardium and peritoneum in healthy individuals 6-9 . Several therapeutic agents targeting MSLN are evaluated in preclinical and clinical studies such as the recombinant immunotoxin SS1P 9-11 . In our fusion protein the anti-MSLN scFv moiety was originally isolated from a yeast-display human scFv library 12 and demonstrated the ability to recognize both membrane-bound and soluble MSLNs and inhibit CA125 MSLN-dependent cell adhesion 13-15 . The recombinant MTBHsp70 protein provides immunostimulatory functions including the activation of monocytes and DCs to produce CC-chemokines that attract antigen processing and presenting DCs macrophages and effector T and B cells enhanced DC aggregation and maturation 1617 induction of the cytotoxic activity of natural killer cells 18 and improved cross-priming of T cells which is dependent on DCs 19 . The capabilities of MTBHsp70 as a potent immune adjuvant have been well characterized in cancer models including murine models of melanoma and lymphoma 1820-24 . While in these studies proteins or peptides fused with Hsp70 used for immunizations in mice were shown to generate humoral or cellular immune responses we expect that fusion of anti-MSLN scFv and MTBHsp70 takes advantage of the immune-activating action of MTBHsp70 and the tumor-targeting activity of the scFv which will yield anti-tumor responses against the broadest profile of tumor antigens. We evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of this MSLN-targeted fusion protein in syngeneic mouse models of ovarian cancer and mesothelioma and examined its mechanism of action in in vitro and in vivo cross-presentation assay systems. These studies demonstrate that this bifunctional fusion protein significantly enhances survival and slows tumor growth through the augmentation of tumor-specific cell-mediated immune responses. Results Expression of scFvMTBHsp70 fusion protein and MTBHsp70 The structure of scFvMTBHsp70 is shown in Figure 1A. VH and VL from anti-MSLN P4 scFv 13 are linked using a (G4S)3 linker and fused to full length MTBHsp70 with a (G4S)3 linker in between. As shown in Figure 1B only one protein band was observed with a molecular weight of approximately 100 kDa for scFvMTBHsp70 and one protein band with a molecular weight of 70 kDa for MTBHsp70 which match the expected molecular weights of these specific proteins. Endotoxin contamination levels in scFvMTBHsp70 and MTBHsp70 were found to be very low at less than 50 EU per mg of protein. Structure and analysis of scFvMTBHsp70 fusion protein. A anti-MSLN VH and VL are linked with a (G4S)3 linker and fused to full length MTBHsp70 with a (G4S)3 linker. B RAPIDstain based on Coomassie dye following purification and hIgG-Fc tag removal of MTBHsp70 and scFvMTBHsp70. C BR5FVB1 ovarian cancer cells and 40L mesothelioma cells were incubated with 40 ?g ml scFvMTBHsp70 or 26 ?g ml MTBHsp70 (blue line) or without either protein (solid) followed by anti-MTBHsp70 (IgG2a) biotinylated anti-IgG2a and Streptavidin-APC and then analyzed by flow cytometry. To confirm that the scFv portion of the fusion protein binds to MSLN on the surface of tumor cells scFvMTBHsp70 or MTBHsp70 was preincubated with 12 ?g ml recombinant human MSLN for 30 min (red line) before being added to the cells. Data are representative of three independent experiments in duplicate tubes. D Median fluorescence intensity (MFI) values of cells stained with scFvMTBHsp70 or MTBHsp70 normalized to cells stained without either protein. Data are expressed as means? ?SEM in arbitrary units. P values were determined using One-Way ANOVA followed by Turkey s multiple comparison tests. p? ?0.05; p? ?0.01;ns non-significant. E scFvMTBHsp70 binds with peritoneal mesothelial cells at a low level compared to ovarian cancer and mesothelioma cells. Binding of the fusion protein is at very low or undetectable levels on PBLs and splenocytes. Thick line with incubation of scFvMTBHsp70; solid without incubation of scFvMTBHsp70. Data are representative of three independent experiments. scFvMTBHsp70 binds to BR5FVB1 ovarian cancer cells and 40L mesothelioma cells through the interaction of scFv with MSLN on the surface of tumor cells Binding of scFvMTBHsp70 or MTBHsp70 to BR5FVB1 ovarian cancer cells or 40L mesothelioma cells as determined by flow cytometry is shown in Figure 1C and D. Binding of scFvMTBHsp70 to MSLN-expressing tumor cells was almost completely inhibited by preincubation of scFvMTBHsp70 with recombinant human MSLN. Although MTBHsp70 also binds to these MSLN-expressing tumor cells the level of binding is not significantly different from background (p? ?0.187 for BR5FVB1 cells and p? ?0.086 for 40L cells). Furthermore the binding of MTBHsp70 to cancer cells cannot be blocked by recombinant MSLN. These data support the view that binding of scFvMTBHsp70 to these tumor cells occurred via the interaction of the scFv portion of the fusion protein with MSLN on the surface of tumor cells. Binding of these proteins with 40L mesothelioma cells was further compared using fluorescence microscopy. scFvMTBHsp70 shows significantly stronger binding intensity as compared to MTBHsp70 (Additional file 1: Figure S1A and B). In order to determine if scFvMTBHsp70 also binds to normal tissue in addition to tumor cells we incubated the fusion protein with peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) splenocytes or peritoneal mesothelial cells from healthy FVB NJ mice and stained the cells using the same method as was used for staining tumor cells. As shown in Figure 1E scFvMTBHsp70 binds with peritoneal mesothelial cells at a low level compared to ovarian cancer and mesothelioma cells. Binding of the fusion protein is at very low or undetectable levels on PBLs and splenocytes. Since scFvMTBHsp70 may potentially target peritoneal mesothelial cells we also explored whether it could induce inflammation in peritoneal mesothelial tissues. We injected na ve mice with saline scFvMTBHsp70 or MTBHsp70 plus P4 scFv at the same doses as those used for tumor therapy described in Method sacrificed the mice 7 days post final treatments and examined haematoxylin and eosin (H E) stained sections prepared from abdominal and intestinal peritoneum. Light microscopic examination revealed no evidence of inflammation and no infiltration of inflammatory cells such as macrophages or granulocytic cells around the mesothelial cells lining the abdominal and intestinal peritoneum of the actively treated or control animals. Representative microscopic images are shown in Additional file 2: Figure S2. scFvMTBHsp70 significantly prolongs ascites-free survival and overall survival in ovarian cancer- or mesothelioma-bearing mice To determine whether scFvMTBHsp70 can prolong survival in tumor-bearing mice we first evaluated the protein in a syngeneic mouse model of papillary ovarian cancer using immune-competent FVB NJ mice. As shown in Figure 2A scFvMTBHsp70 prolonged both ascites-free and overall survival time compared with saline or the equimolar mixture of MTBHsp70 plus P4 scFv. To further support the efficacy of this fusion protein in prolonging survival in MSLN-expressing tumor-bearing mice we evaluated this protein in a second syngeneic mouse model of mesothelioma using immune-competent C57BL 6 mice. Animals treated with scFvMTBHsp70 showed significantly prolonged ascites-free and overall survival time compared with saline- or MTBHsp70 plus P4 scFv- treated mice (Figure 2B). A and B Kaplan-Meier survival curves of tumor-bearing mice following treatment with scFvMTBHsp70 control proteins or normal saline. A In a syngeneic mouse model of papillary ovarian cancer in immune-competent FVB NJ mice scFvMTBHsp70 prolonged ascites-free survival time compared with saline (n? ?10 per group representative of two independent experiments; median survival (Med. sur.)? ?47 days vs. 37.5 days) or the mixture of MTBHsp70 plus P4 scFv (Med. sur. 39 days). scFvMTBHsp70 also prolonged overall survival time in the mice compared with saline (Med. sur. 51.5 days vs. 43 days) or the mixture of MTBHsp70 plus P4 scFv (Med. sur. 43 days). B In a syngeneic mouse model of mesothelioma in immune-competent C57BL 6 mice the fusion protein prolonged ascites-free survival time compared with saline-treated mice (n? ?20 per group pooled from two independent experiments; Med. sur. 28 days vs. 26 days) or the mixture of MTBHsp70 plus P4 scFv (Med. sur. 27 days). The fusion protein also prolonged overall survival time compared with saline (Med. sur. 36 days vs. 31 days). P values were determined using the log-rank test. p? ?0.05; p? ?0.01; p? ?0.001. scFvMTBHsp70 enhances anti-tumor CD8 T-cell responses in ovarian tumor-bearing mice To investigate whether the anti-tumor effects of scFvMTBHsp70 was associated with anti-tumor effector CD8 T-cell responses we re-stimulated splenocytes from ovarian tumor-bearing FVB mice that received different treatments with the CD8 T-cell Her2 neu epitope or MSLN Ld1 as a negative control ex vivo and analyzed the cells for production of IFN? and Granzyme B using flow cytometry. We previously showed that Her2 neu is expressed by BR5FVB1 cells 25 . Ld1 is an in-house designed H2d-restricted MSLN peptide that did not induce ovarian cancer specific T-cell response in H-2q FVB mice. We demonstrated significantly greater anti-Her2 neu CD8 T-cell responses in splenocytes from scFvMTBHsp70-treated mice compared to mice treated with saline or a simple mixture of MTBHsp70 plus P4 scFv as measured by IFN? and Granzyme B production by CD8 T cells (Figure 3A and B). This indicates that scFvMTBHsp70 enhances anti-tumor specific CD8 T-cell responses in ovarian tumor-bearing mice. However no significant difference was seen in the number of tumor-infiltrating CD8 T cells and no tumor-infiltrating Foxp3 T cells were seen in tumors from mice in different treatment groups indicating that scFvMTBHsp70 may improve effector cell function rather than the number of intratumoral CD8 T cells (Additional file 3: Figure S3A and B).

We tested correlations between miR-182 and angiogenic and hypoxia molecular markers. We found significant correlations between miR-182 and FGF2 (r? ??0.147; P? ?0.010) HIF2? (r? ?0.115; P? ?0.047) and MMP-7 (r? ?0.172; P? ?0.003). Univariate analysis As shown in the clinicopathological variables performance status (P? ?0.016) histology (P? ?0.028) tumor differentiation (P? ?0.001) surgical procedure (P? ?0.007) pathological stage (P? ?0.001) tumor status (P? ?0.001) nodal status (P? ?0.001) and vascular infiltration (P? ?0.001) were significant prognostic indicators for DSS. The results from the univariate analyses on miR-182 are presented in and Figures 2 and 3. In the whole cohort there was a tendency towards a better prognosis for those with tumors overexpressing miR-182 (P? ?0.062 ). In subgroup analyses patients with stage II disease had a significantly improved prognosis if they overexpressed miR-182 (P? ?0.003 E). In the histological subgroup SCC high tumor cell miR-182 expression was associated with superior prognosis when compared to low expression (P? ?0.042 A) while for large cell carcinomas the trend was opposite (C). miR-182 in tumor cells and stroma as predictors for disease-specific survival in NSCLC patients (univariate analysis; log-rank test) and results of Cox regression analysis summarizing significant independent prognostic factors Characteristics Pts (n) Pts ( ) Median survival (months) 5-year survival ( ) Univariate (P) Multi-variate (P) HR (95 CI) Total (n? ?335) 0.062 0.098 0.73 ??Low 190 57 98 55 (0.50-1.06) ??High 115 34 NR 62 ??Missing 30 9 Pathological stage Stage I (n? ?143) 0.97 NE NE ??Low 87 61 190 73 ??High 56 39 NR 73 Stage II (n? ?127) 0.003 0.020 0.50 ??Low 80 63 33 39 0.28-0.90 ??High 47 37 NR 63 Stage III (n? ?35) 0.69 NE NE ??Low 23 66 23 39 ??High 12 34 15 17 Histology ??SCC (n? ?172) 0.042 0.048 0.57 ??Low 104 60 NR 58 0.33-0.99 ??High 68 40 NR 74 AC (n? ?106) 0.316 NE NE ??Low 69 65 47 45 ??High 37 35 57 50 LCC (n? ?27) 0.285 NE NE ??Low 17 63 NR 80 ??High 10 37 58 39 Statistically significant results in bold font.

Multivariate analysis In the total cohort performance status (P? ?0.008) histology (P? ?0.001) tumor differentiation (P? ?0.007) tumor status (P? ?0.007) nodal status (P? ?0.022) and vascular infiltration (P? ?0.004) all were independent prognostic factors. Results of the multivariate analysis for miR-182 expression are presented in . Examining the total material high miR-182 expression tended towards an independent association with a better prognosis (HR 0.73 CI 95 0.50-1.06 P? ?0.098). Among stage II patients however high tumor cell expression of miR-182 was an independent positive prognostic factor (HR 0.50 CI 95 0.28-0.90 P? ?0.020). Also in SCC patients with a high miR-182 expression had an independent favorable outcome (HR 0.57 CI 95 0.33-0.99 P? ?0.048). Co-expression of miR-182 with FGF2 and MMP-7 Among markers examined for correlations with miR-182 FGF2 and MMP-7 showed the strongest correlations. We assessed the co-expression combinations between miR-182 and FGF2 and MMP-7 respectively. The co-expression of low miR-182 high FGF2 was associated with poor survival (P? ?0.017) as shown in A. The combination showed an independently significant adverse prognosis compared to high miR-182 low FGF2 (HR 1.92 P? ?0.015 ). Patients expressing high miR-182 high MMP-7 had a better survival than other combinations (P? ?0.036 B). In the multivariate analyses high miR-182 high MMP-7 showed an independently better prognosis than low miR-182 low MMP-7 (HR 0.49 P? ?0.015 ).

Choose exactly one label.", "user": "Text: MBSR is an 8-week group-based training consisting of meditation practices such as the bodyscan gentle yoga sitting and walking meditation. By repeatedly bringing attention back to the current experience participants gradually learn to disengage from dysfunctional thoughts and directly experience the emotions and bodily sensations of the present moment. MBSR aims to provide participants with the ability to step back from ruminating about the past or worrying about the future and simply allow experiences to unfold 2829 . A recent meta-analysis 30 of 13 nonrandomized studies and 9 randomized controlled trials (RCT) concluded there is positive evidence for the use of mindfulness-based interventions in reducing psychological distress in cancer patients. Among the RCT s a reduction in symptom severity was found for both anxiety and depression corresponding to moderate pooled controlled effect sizes (Hedges s g 0.37 and Hedges s g 0.44 respectively) 30 . Though mindfulness-based interventions seem to be effective the authors note that across studies the majority of participants were women (85 ) and diagnosed with breast cancer (77 ). Compared to breast cancer patients patients with lung cancer are more often male older and have a poorer prognosis. Furthermore of these 22 studies only one study included the partners of the patients showing that partners also benefit from the MBSR training 31 . This is quite surprising since partners of cancer patients also report high levels of distress 32 . Aims The aim of the Mindfulness for Lung Oncology Nijmegen (MILON) study is to examine the effectiveness of MBSR compared to TAU in reducing psychological distress in patients with lung cancer and their partners. We hypothesize that patients in the MBSR group will report a lower level of psychological distress (i.e. anxiety and depressive symptoms) higher levels of quality of life quality of relationship and spirituality than those in the TAU group. Medical and societal costs will be lower in the MBSR versus TAU group. We expect partners in the MBSR group to report a lower level of psychological distress and higher levels of caregiver appraisal relationship quality and spirituality than their counterparts in the TAU group. With regard to the working mechanisms of the MBSR programme we will examine changes in mindfulness skills self-compassion rumination intrusion avoidance and adherence to MBSR. Methods Design Study design The design of the MILON study is a parallel group randomized controlled trial with an embedded process study. Participants are randomized between MBSR and TAU. The study protocol has been approved by our ethical review board (CMO Arnhem-Nijmegen) and registered under number 2011 519. Participants and procedure Patients and partners are recruited at the outpatient clinic of the Department of Pulmonary Diseases Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre (RUNMC) by a nurse practitioner and the attending physician. Patients and partners are invited to participate together but both are welcome to participate on their own if they do not have a partner or their partner is not willing to participate. Patients and or partners who are interested are provided with an information leaflet. If they are willing to participate they are invited for a research interview in which in- and exclusion criteria are assessed and informed consent is taken. At other participating hospitals (Department of Pulmonary Diseases Canisius-Wilhelmina Hospital Nijmegen; Department of Pulmonary Medicine Rijnstate Arnhem; Department of Oncology Elkerliek Hospital Helmond; Department of Pulmonary Medicine Jeroen Bosch Hospital; Department of Pulmonary Diseases Maas hospital Pantein Boxmeer) patients and their partners will be sent a letter with the invitation to participate in the study. One week later the researcher calls the patients to answer possible questions and asks whether the patient and partner are interested in participation. If so they are invited for a research interview at the RUNMC. Eligibility We include patients and or partners of patients who are (a) diagnosed with cytologically or histologically proven non-small cell lung cancer or small cell lung cancer and (b) have received or are still under treatment. Exclusion criteria for both patient and partner include: (a) being under 18 years of age (b) not being able to understand or use the Dutch language (c) former participation in MBSR or Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) (d) current and regular treatment by psychologist or psychiatrist (e) current participation in other psychosocial programme and (f) physical or cognitive ( 26 on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)) impairments hampering participation in MBSR training or completion of questionnaires. Baseline Patients and partners are interviewed to obtain demographics and clinical characteristics after which they are screened for cognitive impairments with the MMSE 33 . After that baseline questionnaires including the Distress Thermometer (DT) 3435 are administered followed by randomization. shows the assessment instruments and time points at which the questionnaires are administered to patients and partners.

Randomization Randomization is stratified according to setting and minimized for (a) stage of disease (curative versus palliative) (b) baseline level of anxiety and depressive symptoms (anxiety or depression subscale score of Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) 8 versus ?8) (c) treatment during MBSR (no treatment versus chemo- and or radiotherapy) and (d) participation (patient alone versus partner alone versus patient and partner together). Randomization is computerized using a randomization website specifically designed for this study on which the researcher can fill out the required data. The researcher communicates treatment allocation to the nurse practitioner who informs the patient and or partner. Follow-up assessments Follow-up assessments take place post intervention and at three-month follow-up. Participants who have access to the internet and have an email address receive the questionnaires online. If not they receive the questionnaires on paper along with a reply envelope. In case of drop-out the researcher tries to contact the participant by phone to complete a minimum set of outcome measures and to identify the main reason for drop-out. Intervention The MBSR curriculum used is primarily based on the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction programme as developed by Kabat-Zinn 28 but contains some elements of the MBCT programme by Segal Williams and Teasdale 29 like psycho-education on the interrelatedness of feelings and thoughts. Moreover some modifications have been made to make the intervention more suitable for patients with lung cancer and their partners such as psycho-education about grief 36 . In addition a mindful communication exercise in which partners talk with each other about the cancer was added. The programme consists of 8 weekly 2.5-hour sessions a silent day between session six and seven and home practice assignments of about 45 minutes 6 days per week. Participants receive a set of CDs with guided mindfulness meditation exercises for home practice and a folder with information and home practice instructions for the forthcoming week. Table 2 shows the content of the MBSR programme per session. The MBSR courses are taught by mindfulness teachers with extensive training in MBSR. They all fulfil the advanced criteria of the Center for Mindfulness of the University of Massachusetts Medical School 37 and maintain a regular personal meditation practice. Teachers were trained supervised and assessed to ensure their competency levels met the qualification criteria to instruct the MBSR classes. During the trial teachers will receive weekly supervision and a number of sessions will be videotaped to evaluate competence and adherence with the Mindfulness-Based Interventions Teaching Assessment Criteria 38 .

Background Although dendritic cell (DC) vaccines are considered to be promising treatments for advanced cancer their production and administration is costly and labor-intensive. We developed a novel immunotherapeutic agent that links a single-chain antibody variable fragment (scFv) targeting mesothelin (MSLN) which is overexpressed on ovarian cancer and mesothelioma cells to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) which is a potent immune activator that stimulates monocytes and DCs enhances DC aggregation and maturation and improves cross-priming of T cells mediated by DCs. Methods Binding of this fusion protein with MSLN on the surface of tumor cells was measured by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. The therapeutic efficacy of this fusion protein was evaluated in syngeneic and orthotopic mouse models of papillary ovarian cancer and malignant mesothelioma. Mice received 4 intraperitoneal (i.p.) treatments with experimental or control proteins post i.p. injection of tumor cells. Ascites-free and overall survival time was measured. For the investigation of anti-tumor T-cell responses a time-matched study was performed. Splenocytes were stimulated with peptides and IFN?- or Granzyme B- generating CD3 CD8 T cells were detected by flow cytometry. To examine the role of CD8 T cells in the antitumor effect we performed in vivo CD8 cell depletion. We further determined if the fusion protein increases DC maturation and improves antigen presentation as well as cross-presentation by DCs. Results We demonstrated in vitro that the scFvMTBHsp70 fusion protein bound to the tumor cells used in this study through the interaction of scFv with MSLN on the surface of these cells and induced maturation of bone marrow-derived DCs. Use of this bifunctional fusion protein in both mouse models significantly enhanced survival and slowed tumor growth while augmenting tumor-specific CD8 T-cell dependent immune responses. We also demonstrated in vitro and in vivo that the fusion protein enhanced antigen presentation and cross-presentation by targeting tumor antigens towards DCs. Conclusions This new cancer immunotherapy has the potential to be cost-effective and broadly applicable to tumors that overexpress mesothelin. Mycobacterial Hsp70 Mesothelin Single chain variable fragment Cancer immunotherapy Murine tumor model Background The goal of cancer immunotherapy is to stimulate the immune system to destroy cancer cells. Numerous strategies that involve tumor antigen-specific and non-specific activation of the immune system have been developed. These include dendritic cell (DC) vaccines adoptive T-cell therapy and immune checkpoint blockade 1-3 . Antigen-specific active immunotherapy is expected to be the most attractive strategy because of its capacity to induce both therapeutic and protective T-cell immunity. Among various approaches DC vaccine is considered to be a promising treatment for advanced cancer based on the ability of DCs to orchestrate all of the elements of the immune system. DCs capture tumor antigens process these antigens into peptides as they move to the draining secondary lymphoid ans and present the peptides to na ve T cells thus inducing anti-tumor cellular immune responses. DCs can also activate B cells NK cells and NKT cells 1 . In pre-clinical and clinical studies that exploited DCs as a means to improve vaccine efficiency autologous DCs are loaded ex vivo with antigens and re-administered to the patient. For example Sipuleucel-T (Provenge) that consists of ex vivo activated autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) including antigen-presenting cells (APCs) has resulted in a significant survival benefit in Phase III trials for prostate cancer 4 . However the production and administration of these tailor-made DC vaccines are costly and labor-intensive 5 . As a next-step in the development of DC vaccines we designed a recombinant protein that contains a Mycobacterium tuberculosis heat shock protein 70 (MTBHsp70) fused to a single chain variable fragment (scFv) derived from human B cells that targets mesothelin. Mesothelin (MSLN) is a validated immunotherapy target that is highly overexpressed on the surface of common epithelial cancers including ovarian cancers epithelial malignant mesotheliomas ductal pancreatic adenocarcinomas and lung adenocarcinomas while expressed at relatively low levels only in mesothelial cells lining the pleura pericardium and peritoneum in healthy individuals 6-9 . Several therapeutic agents targeting MSLN are evaluated in preclinical and clinical studies such as the recombinant immunotoxin SS1P 9-11 . In our fusion protein the anti-MSLN scFv moiety was originally isolated from a yeast-display human scFv library 12 and demonstrated the ability to recognize both membrane-bound and soluble MSLNs and inhibit CA125 MSLN-dependent cell adhesion 13-15 . The recombinant MTBHsp70 protein provides immunostimulatory functions including the activation of monocytes and DCs to produce CC-chemokines that attract antigen processing and presenting DCs macrophages and effector T and B cells enhanced DC aggregation and maturation 1617 induction of the cytotoxic activity of natural killer cells 18 and improved cross-priming of T cells which is dependent on DCs 19 . The capabilities of MTBHsp70 as a potent immune adjuvant have been well characterized in cancer models including murine models of melanoma and lymphoma 1820-24 . While in these studies proteins or peptides fused with Hsp70 used for immunizations in mice were shown to generate humoral or cellular immune responses we expect that fusion of anti-MSLN scFv and MTBHsp70 takes advantage of the immune-activating action of MTBHsp70 and the tumor-targeting activity of the scFv which will yield anti-tumor responses against the broadest profile of tumor antigens. We evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of this MSLN-targeted fusion protein in syngeneic mouse models of ovarian cancer and mesothelioma and examined its mechanism of action in in vitro and in vivo cross-presentation assay systems. These studies demonstrate that this bifunctional fusion protein significantly enhances survival and slows tumor growth through the augmentation of tumor-specific cell-mediated immune responses. Results Expression of scFvMTBHsp70 fusion protein and MTBHsp70 The structure of scFvMTBHsp70 is shown in Figure 1A. VH and VL from anti-MSLN P4 scFv 13 are linked using a (G4S)3 linker and fused to full length MTBHsp70 with a (G4S)3 linker in between. As shown in Figure 1B only one protein band was observed with a molecular weight of approximately 100 kDa for scFvMTBHsp70 and one protein band with a molecular weight of 70 kDa for MTBHsp70 which match the expected molecular weights of these specific proteins. Endotoxin contamination levels in scFvMTBHsp70 and MTBHsp70 were found to be very low at less than 50 EU per mg of protein. Figure 1 Structure and analysis of scFvMTBHsp70 fusion protein.

B RAPIDstain based on Coomassie dye following purification and hIgG-Fc tag removal of MTBHsp70 and scFvMTBHsp70. C BR5FVB1 ovarian cancer cells and 40L mesothelioma cells were incubated with 40 ?g ml scFvMTBHsp70 or 26 ?g ml MTBHsp70 (blue line) or without either protein (solid) followed by anti-MTBHsp70 (IgG2a) biotinylated anti-IgG2a and Streptavidin-APC and then analyzed by flow cytometry. To confirm that the scFv portion of the fusion protein binds to MSLN on the surface of tumor cells scFvMTBHsp70 or MTBHsp70 was preincubated with 12 ?g ml recombinant human MSLN for 30 min (red line) before being added to the cells. Data are representative of three independent experiments in duplicate tubes. D Median fluorescence intensity (MFI) values of cells stained with scFvMTBHsp70 or MTBHsp70 normalized to cells stained without either protein. Data are expressed as means? ?SEM in arbitrary units.

E scFvMTBHsp70 binds with peritoneal mesothelial cells at a low level compared to ovarian cancer and mesothelioma cells. Binding of the fusion protein is at very low or undetectable levels on PBLs and splenocytes. Thick line with incubation of scFvMTBHsp70; solid without incubation of scFvMTBHsp70. Data are representative of three independent experiments. scFvMTBHsp70 binds to BR5FVB1 ovarian cancer cells and 40L mesothelioma cells through the interaction of scFv with MSLN on the surface of tumor cells Binding of scFvMTBHsp70 or MTBHsp70 to BR5FVB1 ovarian cancer cells or 40L mesothelioma cells as determined by flow cytometry is shown in Figure 1C and D. Binding of scFvMTBHsp70 to MSLN-expressing tumor cells was almost completely inhibited by preincubation of scFvMTBHsp70 with recombinant human MSLN. Although MTBHsp70 also binds to these MSLN-expressing tumor cells the level of binding is not significantly different from background (p? ?0.187 for BR5FVB1 cells and p? ?0.086 for 40L cells). Furthermore the binding of MTBHsp70 to cancer cells cannot be blocked by recombinant MSLN. These data support the view that binding of scFvMTBHsp70 to these tumor cells occurred via the interaction of the scFv portion of the fusion protein with MSLN on the surface of tumor cells. Binding of these proteins with 40L mesothelioma cells was further compared using fluorescence microscopy. scFvMTBHsp70 shows significantly stronger binding intensity as compared to MTBHsp70 (Additional file 1: Figure S1A and B). In order to determine if scFvMTBHsp70 also binds to normal tissue in addition to tumor cells we incubated the fusion protein with peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) splenocytes or peritoneal mesothelial cells from healthy FVB NJ mice and stained the cells using the same method as was used for staining tumor cells. As shown in Figure 1E scFvMTBHsp70 binds with peritoneal mesothelial cells at a low level compared to ovarian cancer and mesothelioma cells. Binding of the fusion protein is at very low or undetectable levels on PBLs and splenocytes. Since scFvMTBHsp70 may potentially target peritoneal mesothelial cells we also explored whether it could induce inflammation in peritoneal mesothelial tissues. We injected na ve mice with saline scFvMTBHsp70 or MTBHsp70 plus P4 scFv at the same doses as those used for tumor therapy described in Method sacrificed the mice 7 days post final treatments and examined haematoxylin and eosin (H E) stained sections prepared from abdominal and intestinal peritoneum. Light microscopic examination revealed no evidence of inflammation and no infiltration of inflammatory cells such as macrophages or granulocytic cells around the mesothelial cells lining the abdominal and intestinal peritoneum of the actively treated or control animals. Representative microscopic images are shown in Additional file 2: Figure S2. scFvMTBHsp70 significantly prolongs ascites-free survival and overall survival in ovarian cancer- or mesothelioma-bearing mice To determine whether scFvMTBHsp70 can prolong survival in tumor-bearing mice we first evaluated the protein in a syngeneic mouse model of papillary ovarian cancer using immune-competent FVB NJ mice. As shown in Figure 2A scFvMTBHsp70 prolonged both ascites-free and overall survival time compared with saline or the equimolar mixture of MTBHsp70 plus P4 scFv. To further support the efficacy of this fusion protein in prolonging survival in MSLN-expressing tumor-bearing mice we evaluated this protein in a second syngeneic mouse model of mesothelioma using immune-competent C57BL 6 mice. Animals treated with scFvMTBHsp70 showed significantly prolonged ascites-free and overall survival time compared with saline- or MTBHsp70 plus P4 scFv- treated mice (Figure 2B). Figure 2 A and B Kaplan-Meier survival curves of tumor-bearing mice following treatment with scFvMTBHsp70 control proteins or normal saline. A In a syngeneic mouse model of papillary ovarian cancer in immune-competent FVB NJ mice scFvMTBHsp70 prolonged ascites-free survival time compared with saline (n? ?10 per group representative of two independent experiments; median survival (Med. sur.)? ?47 days vs. 37.5 days) or the mixture of MTBHsp70 plus P4 scFv (Med. sur. 39 days). scFvMTBHsp70 also prolonged overall survival time in the mice compared with saline (Med. sur. 51.5 days vs. 43 days) or the mixture of MTBHsp70 plus P4 scFv (Med. sur. 43 days). B In a syngeneic mouse model of mesothelioma in immune-competent C57BL 6 mice the fusion protein prolonged ascites-free survival time compared with saline-treated mice (n? ?20 per group pooled from two independent experiments; Med. sur. 28 days vs. 26 days) or the mixture of MTBHsp70 plus P4 scFv (Med. sur. 27 days). The fusion protein also prolonged overall survival time compared with saline (Med. sur. 36 days vs. 31 days). P values were determined using the log-rank test. p? ?0.05; p? ?0.01; p? ?0.001. scFvMTBHsp70 enhances anti-tumor CD8 T-cell responses in ovarian tumor-bearing mice To investigate whether the anti-tumor effects of scFvMTBHsp70 was associated with anti-tumor effector CD8 T-cell responses we re-stimulated splenocytes from ovarian tumor-bearing FVB mice that received different treatments with the CD8 T-cell Her2 neu epitope or MSLN Ld1 as a negative control ex vivo and analyzed the cells for production of IFN? and Granzyme B using flow cytometry. We previously showed that Her2 neu is expressed by BR5FVB1 cells 25 . Ld1 is an in-house designed H2d-restricted MSLN peptide that did not induce ovarian cancer specific T-cell response in H-2q FVB mice. We demonstrated significantly greater anti-Her2 neu CD8 T-cell responses in splenocytes from scFvMTBHsp70-treated mice compared to mice treated with saline or a simple mixture of MTBHsp70 plus P4 scFv as measured by IFN? and Granzyme B production by CD8 T cells (Figure 3A and B). This indicates that scFvMTBHsp70 enhances anti-tumor specific CD8 T-cell responses in ovarian tumor-bearing mice. However no significant difference was seen in the number of tumor-infiltrating CD8 T cells and no tumor-infiltrating Foxp3 T cells were seen in tumors from mice in different treatment groups indicating that scFvMTBHsp70 may improve effector cell function rather than the number of intratumoral CD8 T cells (Additional file 3: Figure S3A and B).

A Splenocytes harvested from mice treated with scFvMTBHsp70 fusion protein equimolar mixture of MTBHsp70 plus P4 scFv or saline (n 10 per group) were re-stimulated with Her2 neu peptide or MSLN Ld1 peptide.

presented genetic evidence that bcl9 proteins require additional cofactors andthat tbx3 associates with the bcateninbcl9 bound regions on the genome possibly influencing theexpression of target genes however the similarity of genomic binding profiles between tbx3 andbcl9 might be due to their binding in different cells and the decreased expression of genes withnearby enhancers bound by bcl9 and tbx3 might imply a requirement for bcl99l but not necessarily for tbx3 we reasoned that our hypothesis in which bcl9 functionally tethers tbx3 to the bcatenin transcriptional complex raises several testable predictions that will be addressed belowfirst our model implies that tbx3 could impact on wnt target gene expression and its activityshould be dependent on the main constituents of the wntbcatenin transcriptional complex second if tbx3 is tethered by bcl9 to its targets mutations in bcl99l should influence the ability oftbx3 to physically associate with wres finally as for bcl9 tbx3

A comparison of FDR curves based on three data sets. A comparison of false discovery rate (FDR) curve based on our proposed method for concordant integrative gene set enrichment analysis with the FDR curves based on the gene set analysis (GSA) for individual data sets. In each plot the black solid curve represents the results based on our method; the black dashed curve represents the results based on GSA for the Boston data; the black dotted curve represents the results based on GSA for the Michigan data; the black dot-dashed curve represents the results based on GSA for the Stanford data. The gray dotted lines represent three FDR levels: 0.05 0.1 and 0.2. Both up-regulated (a) and down-regulated (b) differential expression based analysis results are presented. Among the gene sets with FDR 0.05 we observed many interesting pathways. Among these 74 identified based on down-regulated differential expression there were pathways related to immune system TCR signaling viral myocarditis BCR signaling cell survival WNT-?-catenin signaling cytokine PI3K VEGF signaling interleukins and GPCR signaling. Among these 99 identified based on up-regulated differential expression there were pathways related to different metabolism cell cycle checkpoints and related phases and transitions DNA replication synthesis damage and repair p53 glycolysis gluconeogenesis telomere maintenance and extension apoptosis TGF-? signaling tRNA aminoacylation gene expression lung cancer and PDGF signaling. Consistency between two application results We also investigated whether the inclusion of an additional data set to our previous integrative analysis of two data sets would still generate consistent results. (Notice that the number of common genes was much reduced from 5216 to 2865 when the Stanford data set was included. This would change the number of selected pathways as shown above.) shows the scatter plot for the paired CES calculated based on two data sets and CES calculated based on three data sets (separately for up-regulated and down-regulated differential expression). For each plot a clear correlation pattern can be observed. The Spearman correlation coefficients were both greater than 0.75 for these two plots (0.804 and 0.760). We also compared the listed of selected pathways with FDR 0.05 (see above for details). For up-regulated differential expression there were 92 pathways in common (among 224 selected based on two data sets and 99 selected based on three data sets); for down-regulated differential expression there were 11 pathways in common (among 15 selected based on two data sets and 74 selected based on three data sets). If (the number of commonly selected pathways) (the number of smallest list of selected pathways) was used as the overlap proportion then we would have 92 99 92.9 and 11 15 73.3 as the overlap proportions for up-regulated and down-regulated differential expression respectively. Therefore a satisfactory consistency between both results was also observed. A comparison of CESs based on two application results. A comparison of our concordant integrative gene set enrichment analysis results based on two data sets to the results based on three data sets. In each plot the gray dots represent the paired concordant enrichment scores (CESs) for all pathways in the Version 3.0 of the C2 canonical pathway collection and the black dots represent the paired CESs for pathways with FDR 0.05 for both analysis results. Both up-regulated (a) and down-regulated (b) differential expression based analysis results are presented. About two pathways mentioned particularly in our first application there were two proteasome pathways in the Version 3.0 of the C2 canonical pathway collection: one given by BioCarta and the other given by KEGG. For both pathways their CESs and FDRs for up-regulated differential expression were consistently respectively 0.999 and 0.001 based on our integrative analysis of two data sets and these values were also consistently respectively 0.95 and 0.005 based on our integrative analysis of three data sets. There were also two BCR signaling pathways collected by KEGG and Signaling Gateway their CESs and FDRs for down-regulated differential expression were consistently respectively 0.95 and 0.01 based on our integrative analysis of three data sets. Based on our integrative analysis of two data sets the CES and FDR for the pathway by KEGG were respectively 0.7 and 0.2 and these two values for the pathway by Signaling Gateway were respectively 0.9 and 0.05. shows different paired z-scores from three data sets and the z-scores for these two pathways are highlighted for an illustration. Illustrative examples based on three data sets. Two illustrative examples for our proposed method for a concordant integrative gene set enrichment analysis of three data sets. In each plot the gray dots represent all paired z-scores for 2865 common human genes and the black dots represent the paired z-scores for the gene set specified in the title. KEGG cancer pathways There is a collection of cancer pathways in the database of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG with web link http: www.genome.jp kegg ). According to the database updated on July 242013 17 pathways are associated with lung cancer and general cancer studies. lists 16 of these pathways that are also in the Version 3.0 of the C2 canonical pathway collection. (The KEGG PI3K-AKT signaling pathway is not included since it is not listed in the C2 collection. Notice that only pathways from KEGG are included. Pathways with same or similar names from other online databases like Reactome are not considered here. This ensures the consistency between the gene sets from the C2 collection and the gene sets mentioned in the KEGG cancer pathways.) Since a pathway could be enriched in either up-regulated or down-regulated differential expression we would choose the one with larger CES if the absolute difference of two CESs was greater than 0.1 (same results observed when this threshold value was set between 0.05 to 0.15) which was a conservative choice of threshold value. Otherwise we would not present any further analysis results for this pathway. For examples if these two CESs were 0.5 (up-regulated) and 0.45 (down-regulated) then no further analysis results would be presented for this pathway; if these two CESs were 0.8 (up-regulated) and 0.1 (down-regulated) then the analysis results based on up-regulated differential expression would be presented. For these 16 pathways listed in the results from the analysis described in our first and second applications were consistent. All the pathways except the TGF-? signaling pathway showed FDRs 0.2 for at least one applications. Ten and eight pathways showed FDRs 0.1 and FDRs 0.05 respectively for at least one applications.

{"system": "You are a medical text classifier. Choose exactly one label.", "user": "Text: The occurrence of PLC is extremely rare in liver carcinoma. Herein we report the case of a patient with PLC after liver transplantation due to liver carcinoma. PLC was confirmed by clinical manifestations imaging studies and cytologic examination of exfoliated cells in the pleural effusion. Liver carcinoma Liver transplantation Metastasis Pulmonary lymphangitic carcinomatosis Background Primary liver carcinoma is a malignancy originating from hepatocytes and or intrahepatic biliary epithelial cells. In China there are more than 90 million carriers of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) accounting for 40 to 45 of HBV carriers worldwide. The high prevalence of HBV in China is the underlying reason why liver carcinoma is the malignancy with the highest morbidity and mortality rates in China. Currently resection and liver transplantation are major strategies for the treatment of liver carcinoma. For patients with hepatic cirrhosis liver transplantation can cure both the cancer and liver cirrhosis. However liver carcinoma may recur or metastasize after resection or liver transplantation mainly via the hematogenous route. Although lymphatic metastasis can occur metastasis is usually found in the hepatic hilus upper abdomen and retroperitoneal lymph nodes 1 . Pulmonary lymphangitic carcinomatosis (PLC) is a special manifestation of metastatic cancer in the lymphatic vessels of the lung that is characterized by diffuse or focal growth. Most PLC cases originate from adenocarcinomas. PLC is rare in liver carcinoma patients. To the best of our knowledge no studies reported to date have described PLC after liver transplantation. Case presentation A 45-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with a complaint of repeated episodes of abdominal distension. He was diagnosed with HBV-induced hepatic cirrhosis and liver carcinoma (T3N0M0). He underwent liver transplantation without any metastasis before the operation. Pathological analysis identified a tumor (12 cm? ?8 cm? ?10 cm) in the right lobe of the liver within which the cancer cells were arranged in nests and pleomorphism was seen. These findings together with the results of immunohistochemistry demonstrated features of mixed liver carcinoma: ?-fetoprotein ( ) hepatocytes ( ) CD34 ( ) CD19 ( ) CD10 (focal ) synaptophysin (-) chromogranin A (-) and cytokeratin (pan ) (). The function of the graft liver was favorable. FK506 was used alone for antirejection therapy. Immunohistochemical staining of mixed liver carcinoma tissue specimens. (A) Cancer cells were arranged in nests and showed atypia. The interstitium was rich in sinusoids and invasive growth was noted. (B) Image showing cytokeratin 19 (CK19) ( ). (C) Image showing CK7 ( ). All three images are stained with hematoxylin and eosin and were scanned at 100 original magnification. Two months later the patient developed a dry cough of unknown etiology and his condition deteriorated 1 week later. Expectoration was occasionally present accompanied by chest tightness shortness of breath and hypoxemia (75 mmHg partial pressure of oxygen). Fever and chills were absent and the patient s white blood cell count neutrophil count and inflammatory factors were normal. His sputum culture was negative. Lung computed tomography (CT) suggested infectious lesions in the lung which were characterized by interstitial changes. Right-sided pleural effusion and segmental atelectasis in the lower lobe of the right lung were noted. Several enlarged lymph nodes were identified in the mediastinum (A). Thoracentesis was immediately performed and approximately 2000 ml of light yellow fluid was collected. The patient s chest tightness and shortness of breath improved significantly. Posttransplantation interstitial pneumonia was considered at first. FK506 was discontinued and methylprednisolone (40 mg every 12 hours) caspofungin sulfamethoxazole (SMZ) and aminophylline were administered. Computed tomography scans of the lungs. (A) Soon after the appearance of the patient s respiratory symptoms a computed tomography (CT) scan revealed septal thickening of the peribronchovascular interstitium pleural effusion segmental atelectasis in the right lower lobe of the lung and several enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum. (B) Discontinuation of anti-infection therapy and 5 days after thoracentesis extensive involvement of the parenchyma with septal thickening was evident with reticulonodular densities in all lung fields. Five days later a lung CT scan showed reexpansion of the right lung and diffuse exudate in the interstitium. Multiple nodules were found in both lungs (B). Pulmonary function tests showed severe obstructive ventilatory dysfunction and moderate reduction in carbon monoxide diffusion capacity. Examination of exfoliated cells in the pleural effusion showed cancer cells (). Positron emission tomography (PET)-CT indicated multiple nodules and patchy or cloudy shadows with high density in both lungs (maximal standardized uptake value (SUV) approximately 6.27). Several enlarged lymph nodes were found in the mediastinum hepatic hilus and retroperitoneum (maximal SUV approximately 8.39). Moreover lesions with increased density were found in the left third rib the right upper femur and the left acetabulum which were accompanied by an increase in fluorodeoxyglucose. The patient was diagnosed with PLC after liver transplantation due to liver carcinoma. Cancer cells among the exfoliated cells in the pleural effusion are shown. All slides are stained with hematoxylin and eosin and were photographed under light microscope at 400 original magnification. The treatment with steroid and aminophylline continued to improve the status of the patient s interstitial lesions. Although antirejection therapy was stopped rejection did not occur and the function of the graft liver was stable. Oral capecitabine was administered but was not effective. The patient experienced increasing chest tightness and shortness of breath and he died as a result of respiratory failure 1 month later. Discussion PLC was first described by Troisier in 1873. About 30 to 40 of malignancies may present with metastasis to the lung and PLC accounts for approximately 6 to 8 of metastatic cancer in the lung. Most PLCs originate from adenocarcinomas and they are most often due to lung cancer followed by breast cancer and gastric cancer 23 . Patients with renal cancer cervical cancer thyroid cancer and melanoma rarely develop PLC 4-6 . The pathologic features of PLC include infiltration of cancer cells and interstitial edema in and around lymphatic vessels as well as infiltration of inflammatory cells caused by lymph node metastasis in the lung. The metastatic cancer in the mediastinal and pulmonary hilar lymph nodes may obstruct lymphatic drainage resulting in retrograde migration of cancer cells into terminal lung tissues via lymphatic vessels or anterograde migration of cancer cells in the pleura into the pulmonary hilar lymph nodes through intrapulmonary lymph vessels. In addition a cancer embolus may form in the terminal vessels of the lung due to hematogenous metastasis which can invade the surrounding lymphatic vessels. Thus hilar and mediastinal lymph node metastasis may be present or absent in PLC depending on the route of metastasis of the primary cancer. Extrahepatic metastasis of liver carcinoma is mostly found in the lung adrenal gland bone and central nervous system. Hematogenous spread is thought to be the most common extrahepatic metastatic route 78 .\nLabels: [Thyroid_Cancer, Colon_Cancer, Lung_Cancer]\nReply with one label only.", "assistant": "Lung_Cancer"}
{"system": "You are a medical text classifier. Choose exactly one label.", "user": "Text: To identify these transformation-permissive cells we induced K-RasG12V expression in a very limited number of adult lung cells (0.2 ) and monitored their fate by X-Gal staining a surrogate marker coexpressed with the K-RasG12V oncoprotein. Four weeks later 30 of these cells had proliferated to form small clusters. However only SPC alveolar type II (ATII) cells were able to form hyperplastic lesions some of which progressed to adenomas and adenocarcinomas. In contrast induction of K-RasG12V expression in lung cells by intratracheal infection with adenoviral-Cre ps generated hyperplasias in all regions except the proximal airways. Bronchiolar and bronchioalveolar duct junction hyperplasias were primarily made of CC10 Clara cells. Some of them progressed to form benign adenomas. However only alveolar hyperplasias exclusively made up of SPC ATII cells progressed to yield malignant adenocarcinomas. Adenoviral infection induced inflammatory infiltrates primarily made of T and B cells. This inflammatory response was essential for the development of K-RasG12V driven bronchiolar hyperplasias and adenomas but not for the generation of SPC ATII lesions. Finally activation of K-RasG12V during embryonic development under the control of a Sca1 promoter yielded CC10 but not SPC hyperplasias and adenomas. These results taken together illustrate that different types of lung cells can generate benign lesions in response to K-Ras oncogenic signals. However in adult mice only SPC ATII cells were able to yield malignant adenocarcinomas. inflammation genetically engineered mouse model non-small cell lung cancer lung stem cells J Clin Oncol J.

The data warehouse assembled to guide the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 was used. Methods Data from 13 trials (5480 patients with metastatic breast cancer non small-cell lung cancer or colorectal cancer) were randomly split (60:40) into training and validation data sets. In all 27 pairs of cut points for PR and PD were considered: PR (10 to 50 decrease by 5 increments) and PD (10 to 20 increase by 5 increments) for which 30 and 20 correspond to the RECIST categorization. Cox proportional hazards models with landmark analyses at 12 and 24 weeks stratified by study and number of lesions (fewer than three v three or more) and adjusted for average baseline tumor size were used to assess the impact of each metric on overall survival (OS). Model discrimination was assessed by using the concordance index (c-index). Results Standard RECIST cut points demonstrated predictive ability similar to the alternate PR and PD cut points. Regardless of tumor type the TriTR DiTR and DCR metrics had similar predictive performance. The 24-week metrics (albeit with higher c-index point estimate) were not meaningfully better than the 12-week metrics. None of the metrics did particularly well for breast cancer. Conclusion Alternative cut points to RECIST standards provided no meaningful improvement in OS prediction. Metrics assessed at 12 weeks have good predictive performance.

Introduction: Detection of the ALK rearrangement in a solid tumor gives these patients the option of crizotinib as an oral form of anticancer treatment. The current test of choice is fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) but various cheaper and more convenient immunohistochemical (IHC) assays have been proposed as alternatives. Methods: Fifteen FISH-positive cases from patients seven with data on crizotinib therapy and clinical response were evaluated for the presence of ALK protein using three different commercially available antibodies: D5F3 using the proprietary automated system (Ventana) ALK1 (Dako) and 5A4 (Abcam). A further 14 FISH-negative and three uncertain ( 15 rearrangement detected) cases were also retrieved. Of the total 32 specimens 17 were excisions and 15 were computed tomography-guided biopsies or cytological specimens. All three antibodies were applied to all cases. Antibodies were semiquantitatively scored on intensity and the proportion of malignant cells stained was documented. Cutoffs were set by receiver operating curve analysis for positivity to optimize correct classification. Results: All three IHC assays were 100 specific but sensitivity did vary: D5F3 86 ALK 79 5A4 71 . Intensity was the most discriminating measure overall with a combination of proportion and intensity not improving the test. No FISH-negative IHC-positive cases were seen. Two FISH-positive cases were negative with all three IHC assays. One of these had been treated with crizotinib and had failed to show clinical response. The other harbored a second driving mutation in the EGFR gene. Conclusions: IHC with all three antibodies is especially highly specific (100 ) although variably sensitive (71 -86 ) specifically in cases with scanty material. D5F3 assay was most sensitive in these latter cases. Occasional cases are IHC-positive but FISH-negative suggesting either inaccuracy of one assay or occasional tumors with ALK rearrangement that do not express high levels of ALK protein. Pulmonary adenocarcinoma ALK Immunohistochemistry Fluorescence in situ hybridization Crizotinib OPEN-ACCESS TRUE Rearrangements of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene drive the malignant phenotype in 3 to 7 of primary lung adenocarcinomas.1 5 The resulting fusion protein most often a fusion with echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (ELM4) has a constitutively active tyrosine kinase domain. The small molecule drug crizotinib is a specific inhibitor of this kinase6 and cases with the rearrangement respond to crizotinib treatment.7 Therefore accurate rapid and inexpensive identification of tumors growing under the influence of translocated ALK is needed. Currently the only test approved by the FDA is fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using break-apart probes (Vysis Abbott Molecular Abbott Park IL). This test is regarded as the gold standard for detection of re-arrangements and is recommended by CAP International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer AMP.8 However FISH is technically demanding expensive and many diagnostic laboratories lack either the expertise or the facilities to perform the test. Even in ideal circumstances the results are often difficult to interpret requiring the scrutiny of large numbers of individual cells by a highly experienced diagnostician. Furthermore there are rare circumstances (such as small intrachromosomal inversion) in which the FISH test is negative but the tumor nevertheless expresses EML4-ALK fusion protein.59 11 A cheaper and potentially more widely applicable method is immunohistochemistry (IHC); indeed overexpression of ALK protein has been used in the diagnosis of anaplastic large-cell lymphoma for many years. Although early studies in lung cancer lacked sensitivity45 more recent studies have shown greater specificity and sensitivity8 11 and recent international guidelines (CAP International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer AMP) have recommended that if clinically validated IHC may be used as a screening test for FISH testing.8 However there have been few comparative studies on the most appropriate antibody to use. The aim of this study was therefore to compare three different immunohistochemical assays two being routine methods using antibodies widely used in the diagnosis of lymphoma with the third being a proprietary system including signal amplification that is currently being promoted as an alternative to FISH (Ventana). We also evaluated the relationships between ALK rearrangement as detected by FISH IHC and patient response to therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS Clinical Samples The diagnostic archives from the Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust and Royal Marsden hospitals from 2007 onwards were reviewed to identify cases with a diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma that tested positive for an ALK rearrangement ( 15 positive cells) and a randomly selected complementary group of cases with a normal ALK locus for comparison. We had been testing all primary lung tumors regardless of stage as part of a feasibility study which led to a large number of early stage cases being included. More recently our current policy is only to test advanced cases of non-squamous non small-cell carcinoma using IHC screening with confirmatory FISH as per recently published guidelines.8 The cases under study are summarized in Table 1. TABLE 1. Summary Data of All Cases Included in the Study Paraffin blocks from a total of 32 diagnostic cases were retrieved; 15 of these had tested positive for the ALK rearrangement by FISH three were uncertain (with 15 of cells showing rearrangement) and the remaining 14 cases were negative. All but two blocks dated from 2011 or later. Seventeen cases were blocks from tumor excisions (six of these were FISH positive) and the remainder were cytological or core biopsy endobronchial ultrasound samples. Data on treatment with crizotinib and response were retrieved from patient records. Cases with at least partial response to treatment defined according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria12 (i.e. at least 30 decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions) were designated as responsive . The study was evaluated and classified as a service evaluation by the Imperial College Heads of Consortia and as such was exempt from Research Ethics Committee review. Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization Unstained 2 ?m FFPE sections were put through deparaffinization and protease pretreatment steps before being denatured and hybridized overnight with the commercially available Vysis ALK dual color break apart probe (Abbott Molecular). Tissue sections then underwent SSC washes and were mounted in 4'6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for nuclei counterstaining. Results were analyzed and interpreted in accordance with probe manufacturer s instructions. Non-rearranged ALK showed as fused (yellow) signals. Rearranged ALK appeared as split 3? (red) and 5? (green) signals or an isolated 3? (red) signal. The recommended cutoff of 15 was used to interpret samples as positive or negative for ALK rearrangements in 200 nuclei. Immunohistochemistry An additional five sections were cut per case. Three were used for the immunohistochemical assays and the remaining two for negative controls. Immunohistochemical assays were optimized using the monoclonal antibodies D5F3 (Ventana) ALK1 (Dako) and 5A4 (Abcam). The D5F3 assay was performed using the Ventana autostainer and a tyramide amplification step as specified in the manufacturer s protocol. The other assays were performed using a Dako autostainer with conventional polymer-based diaminobenzidine staining (no tyramide amplification). Details of the antibodies and conditions employed are given in Table 2. TABLE 2. Immunohistochemical Assay Conditions Used Scoring Immunohistochemically stained sections were examined without knowledge of FISH status by two pathologists independently. Scores for proportion and intensity of immunohistochemical staining were assigned by consensus. The predominant intensity of staining was recorded on a scale of 0 3 (0 negative 1 weak 2 moderate 3 strong). As the Ventana stain was more intense due at least partly to the signal amplification step the visual cutoffs for intensity scoring with this antibody were different (e.g. a moderate degree of intensity seen with the Ventana stain would usually be interpreted as strong on a section stained with 5A4). The proportion of malignant cells staining positive was recorded as per Allred estrogen receptor scoring in breast cancer on a scale of 0 5 (0 0 1 ? 1 2 1 10 3 11 33 4 34 66 and 5 ? 66 ). A composite score (intensity proportion) was also derived. Statistical Analysis Statistical analyses were performed using the STATA IC package. RESULTS Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization Slides were scored according to the manufacturer s recommendations. Representative FISH images are shown in Figure 1A. The 15 positive cases all showed greater than 15 cells with rearranged ALK genes. Three cases were classified as indeterminate ; these were all scanty biopsy or cytological samples with 10 to 15 of positively rearranged FISH signals. Seventeen further cases were FISH negative. FIGURE 1. (A) Representative fluorescence in situ hybridization images showing normal fused signals (neg) and nuclei with multiple separated red signals (pos). (B) Three representative excision specimens of adenocarcinoma. Case 1 is negative with all three immunohistochemical assays; the D5F3 assay shows relatively high background presumably because of the tyramide signal amplification (TSA) step. Cases 2 and 3 are positive with all three immunohistochemical assays with clear cytoplasmic staining. The markedly reduced signal seen with the 5A4 and ALK1 assays in case 2 was typical and again probably related to the absence of tyramide amplification. Case 3 demonstrates that occasional cases show strong staining using the non-TSA assays. Immunohistochemistry No signal was observed in negative controls. The intensity of staining between the three antibodies varied (Fig. 1B). IHC was impossible to assess in three cases with very scanty material (two FISH negative and one FISH positive). The Ventana assay using the D5F3 antibody gave the most intense cytoplasmic signal but this was accompanied by higher background staining which was especially noticeable in macrophages. The ALK1 and 5A4 antibody assays produced weaker staining but with less background. Of the two 5A4 had marginally more background staining especially in macrophages. The value of both intensity and proportion scores was assessed. Cutoffs for positivity were set using ROC analysis to optimize correct classification of ALK status using FISH results as the standard (Table 3). The intensity score alone was seen to outperform both proportion and the aggregate score. Therefore intensity scoring using the optimized cutoff was used in subsequent analyses. TABLE 3. Optimised Cutoff Values for Immunohistochemical Tests Concordance between FISH and IHC is shown in Table 4. No cases with negative FISH results and positive IHC were identified (100 specificity of IHC in these data). Sensitivity was the same (83 ) for all three assays in excision specimens. In small biopsies and cytological specimens however the D5F3 antibody was the most sensitive. The ALK1 and 5A4 assays failed to identify a further one or two FISH-positive cases respectively. All three assays failed to stain the same two cases which contain rearranged ALK genes detectable by FISH. TABLE 4. Concordance of Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) Assays Response to Therapy Seven cases with ALK rearrangements detected by FISH went on to receive crizotinib therapy. All but one showed at least a partial response. This crizotinib-refractory case showed no detectable ALK expression by all three IHC assays. DISCUSSION We have compared three different antibody assays for the ALK kinase domain to the current standard FISH assay in a set of archival tumors including 15 FISH-positive cases. We found all three assays to be specific (100 ) and sensitive (up to 86 ) especially when a signal amplification technique is employed. Furthermore data on response to crizotinib therapy in seven treated cases showed all but one case responded. The case that failed to respond to therapy was negative by all three IHC assays. Of the three antibody methods compared the D5F3 antibody using a Ventana proprietary assay performed the best especially in scanty samples which is likely to be a consequence of the tyramide signal amplification step incorporated into the Ventana assay. It is possible that the other two antibodies would perform as well if a suitable signal amplification step were introduced. However an assay using the 5A4 without tyramide amplification has been successfully applied by To et al in a recent comparable assessment of IHC as a test for ALK rearrangement.5 In a set of 373 tumors that included 20 ALK rearrangements as detected by FISH their IHC assay was 99 specific and 100 sensitive. In contrast to this we find 100 specificity and (at best) 86 sensitivity; that is to say we identified rare FISH-positive IHC-negative cases whereas To et al found occasional FISH-negative IHC-positive cases which were proved to harbor EML4-ALK rearrangements by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).5 It is unsurprising that we do not identify FISH-negative IHC-positive cases as we only examined 17 FISH-negative or indeterminate cases in comparison to the 356 examined by To et al.5 It is more notable that To et al.5 do not identify FISH-positive IHC-negative cases. This might be explained by their use of tissue microarrays for FISH which is even more technically demanding and hard to interpret than FISH using whole sections. This possible shortcoming of tissue microarray methods might be apparent in two other recent studies using tissue microarrays for a comparison of FISH with ALK1 5A4 and D5F3 antibodies.1314 Selinger et al.13 describe 100 sensitivity for all three antibody assays. Conklin et al.14 also find 100 sensitivity and a maximum specificity of 88 (again using the 5A4 antibody). Again it may be that in both these additional studies the approach used hampered the identification of FISH-positive IHC-negative cases because of the difficulty of applying FISH to TMAs especially when the primary test has been IHC and the FISH test is not blind to the IHC result. Other recent studies compare various immunohistochemical assays and FISH for the detection of ALK rearrangements.1516 As in this study Sholl et al.15 identify occasional FISH-positive IHC-negative cases. They explain two cases by identifying co-existent mutations in other driving oncogenes (presumably thereby relieving the tumor addiction to ALK) and one by insufficient tumor material for accurate IHC assessment. Savic et al.16 compared an immunocytochemical assay using the 5A4 antibody to FISH in cytological specimens and achieved a sensitivity of 93 and specificity of 96 which is comparable with our findings in cytological and small biopsy cases (sensitivity 88 specificity 100 ). In the current study we detected two false-negative cases which were positive by FISH and negative by all three IHC assays.\nLabels: [Thyroid_Cancer, Colon_Cancer, Lung_Cancer]\nReply with one label only.", "assistant": "Lung_Cancer"}

Choose exactly one label.", "user": "Text: Based on the above analysis we speculated that there may be some interaction between p120ctn isoform 3A and snail which plays a role in suppressing EMT in lung cancer cells expressing cytoplasmic E-cadherin but this hypothesis requires further study. Importantly we also found that knockdown of p120ctn-1A in SPC cells with cytoplasmic E-cadherin resulted in decreased twist expression (B). Meanwhile transfection of LK2 cells which also showed cytoplasmic localization of E-cadherin with the p120ctn isoform 1A plasmid resulted in increased twist expression (B). However no changes in twist expression were observed in the rest of the experiments (A 4A). As a transcription factor and master gene regulator of EMT 39 40 twist can downregulate E-cadherin expression 41 and upregulate N-cadherin and other mesenchymal biomarkers 42 . Increased twist expression in LK2 cells transfected with the p120ctn isoform 1A plasmid indicated that transcriptional activation took place and further suggested that the p120ctn isoform 1A may have translocated into the nucleus upon binding of E-cad CTF2 in the cytoplasm consequently activating the Wnt signaling pathway to promote EMT. Decreased twist expression in SPC cells transfected with p120ctn-1A-siRNA indicated that transcriptional activity was downregulated and suggested that ablation of p120ctn isoform 1A resulted in the inhibtion of EMT by removing the stimulatory effect of the Wnt signaling activity by p120ctn isoform 1A. In the H460 and H1299 cells with E-cadherin localized in the membrane the unchanged twist expression confirmed that p120ctn isoforms 1A and 3A could bind to E-cadherin and maintain effective cell-cell adhesion in order to suppress EMT instead of affecting the Wnt twist pathway. Intriguingly overexpression of p120ctn isoform 3A did not change twist expression in LK2 cells expressing cytoplasmic E-cadherin indicating that p120ctn isoform 3A did not activate transcription. Therefore we firmly believe in the above hypothesis that p120ctn isoform 3A may interact with snail in some manner to influence E-cadherin expression and suppress EMT in lung cancer cells carrying cytoplasmic E-cadherin. Previous studies have observed that p120ctn-1A restored the cytoplasmic expression of E-cadherin whereas p120ctn-3A could not 20 which seems to be contradictory with the results of this study. However the method in previous studies of knocking down p120ctn expression and then transfecting p120ctn isoforms 1A and 3A plasmids into cells is different from that in the current study in which cells were only transiently transfected with p120ctn isoforms 1A and 3A plasmids. Therefore the different research methods may have led to different effects on E-cadherin. We also noted that in previous studies decreased and almost undetectable levels of E-cadherin by ablation of p120ctn resulted in the failure of exogenous p120ctn-1A to translocate into the nucleus to activate the Wnt b-catenin pathway and decrease E-cadherin expression due to the deletion of the binding partner E-cad CTF2. However the LK2 and H1299 cell lines used in these experiments expressed E-cadherin in the present study. E-cadherin binds primarily to unphosphorylated p120ctn isoform 3A whereas tyrosine-phosphorylated p120ctn isoform 1A interacts exclusively with N-cadherin 23 . In the previous studies exogenous p120ctn isoform 3A was prevented from binding and stabilizing E-cadherin after its ablation while in the present study the exogenous p120ctn isoform 3A could stabilize E-cadherin expression directly on the membrane or indirectly by increasing its cytoplasmic expression via regulation of snail expression. Of course all of these findings will need to be further investigated. In we for the first time found that p120ctn isoforms 1A and 3A to have different functions in EMT of lung cancer cells with E-cadherin expressed in different subcellular locations. When E-cadherin was localized on the cell membrane p120ctn isoforms 1A and 3A both could inhibit EMT and reduce the cell invasiveness phenotype. When E-cadherin was localized in the cytoplasm p120ctn isoform 1A promoted EMT and enhanced cell invasion while p120ctn isoform 3A inhibited EMT and reduced cell invasiveness. We thank Dr. Albert B. Reynolds (Department of Cancer Biology Vanderbilt University School of Medicine TN USA) for kindly providing p120ctn isoforms 1A and 3A cDNA plasmids.

In biomedical research a health effect is frequently associated with protracted exposures of varying intensity sustained in the past. The main complexity of modeling and interpreting such phenomena lies in the additional temporal dimension needed to express the association as the risk depends on both intensity and timing of past exposures. This type of dependency is defined here as exposure lag response association. In this contribution I illustrate a general statistical framework for such associations established through the extension of distributed lag non-linear models originally developed in time series analysis. This modeling class is based on the definition of a cross-basis obtained by the combination of two functions to flexibly model linear or nonlinear exposure-responses and the lag structure of the relationship respectively. The methodology is illustrated with an example application to cohort data and validated through a simulation study. This modeling framework generalizes to various study designs and regression models and can be applied to study the health effects of protracted exposures to environmental factors drugs or carcinogenic agents among others. 2013 The Authors.

Introduction In biomedical research it is commonly appreciated that an exposure event produces effects lasting well beyond the exposure period with an increase in risk occurring from few hours to many years later depending on the physiological processes linking the exposure and the health outcome. The problem is made even more complicated in the presence of protracted time-varying exposures when the health effect measured at a given time can be described as the result of multiple exposure events of different intensities sustained in the past. This phenomenon common to various research fields has been associated for example with peak 1 or chronic exposures 2 to environmental stressors drug intake 34 or occupational exposures to carcinogenic substances 5. The main complexity of modeling and interpreting such dependencies lies in the additional temporal dimension needed to express the association beyond the usual exposure response relationship as the risk depends on both intensity and timing of past exposures. Nonetheless the appropriate representation of the temporal pattern of risks may provide further insights on the association of interest in particular regarding the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and prevent biases in estimates and predictions. Revising previous terminology 6 I define these dependencies as exposure lag response associations. In particular this issue has been debated in cancer epidemiology 7 9. Analytical approaches extend simple indices such as cumulative exposure in order to accommodate the temporal variation in risk because of protracted exposures. In particular the pioneering work by Thomas 106 helped develop sophisticated statistical methods on the basis of weighting past exposures through specific functions whose parameters are estimated by the data. Vacek 11 Langholz and colleagues 12 and Richardson 13 provided interesting applications in case-control studies with weights represented through simple parametric functions. The methodology was improved by Hauptmann and colleagues in a series of papers 14 16 by using flexible and smooth spline functions. Sylvestre and Abrahamowicz 17 and Abrahamowicz and colleagues 18 extended the spline methods to the analysis of time-to-event data with a cohort design and presented their applications in pharmaco-epidemiology. The main limitation of the statistical techniques described in these papers is the assumption of a linear exposure response relationship. Models for nonlinear dependencies introduce further nontrivial complexities from both statistical and interpretational perspectives as the problem becomes inherently bidimensional. Abrahamowicz and Mackenzie 19 proposed a model for analyzing the nonlinear time-dependent effects of fixed exposures while Vacek 11 and Berhane and colleagues 20 extended this scheme to the case of protracted time-varying exposures. However the modeling techniques illustrated in these other papers still face some limitations as they are based on complex estimation routines with convergence issues and problems in producing uncertainty measures such as standard errors and confidence intervals. Interestingly equivalent approaches were previously established in time series analysis on the basis of distributed lag models (DLMs) a methodology originally formulated in econometrics 21 then applied in epidemiological research 22. These models involve the definition of a distributed lag function analogous to the weighting function described before. In particular Armstrong 23 generalized the method to distributed lag non-linear models (DLNMs) a class of models with different options for the functions applied to model nonlinearity and distributed lag effects. The theory of DLMs and DLNMs have been recently re-evaluated 24 offering a well-grounded statistical tool and a comprehensive scheme for interpretation. In this paper I aim to establish a general conceptual and statistical framework for modeling exposure lag response associations built upon the paradigm of DLMs and DLNMs. This modeling class extended beyond time series analysis provides a unified methodology applicable in different study designs data structures and regression models including most of the previous methods as specific cases. Also the statistical framework is defined by completely parametric functions and fitted through standard regression methods with measures of uncertainty and fit statistics easily available. The R package dlnm originally developed for time series data 25 is extended in parallel offering a easy-to-use implementation of the modeling approach. The manuscript is structured as follows. The development and algebraic definition of the modeling framework is described in Section 2. As an illustrative example in I apply the method for investigating the relationship between occupational exposure to radon and lung cancer mortality by using the data from the Colorado Plateau miners cohort. The modeling framework is then validated in a simulation study n. A final discussion is provided in. Information on data and software implementation is included in. The R code and data are included in the supporting information together with additional details making the results of the illustrative example and of the simulation study entirely reproducible. 2. Modeling framework The modeling skeleton is derived by extending the class of DLNMs beyond the time series context. This extension provides a neat algebraic representation and a comprehensive statistical definition. The focus is on a function here defined s(xt) which describes the dependency in terms of the exposure history to x evaluated at time t. The function s(xt) is commonly included in regression models in order to estimate the association while controlling for potential confounders. Although the regression model varies depending on the study design and the type of data the definition of s(xt) provided later and the related modeling framework generally apply. 2.1. Models for linear exposure response relationships Previous studies on the topic have defined the function s(xt) by using slightly different algebraic formulae 1026111417. Assuming a linear exposure response relationship a general notation can be given by (1a) (1b) (1c) In (1a) the increase in risk at time t is defined as the integral of the instantaneous exposure intensity xu over the period ?t t0t1 with t0 and t1 representing the times of the first and last relevant exposures. Here w(t ? u) is the weighting function previously described in which assigns weights to past exposures experienced at time t ? u on the basis of their contribution to the risk at time t. The model can be reparameterized as in (1b) where the risk is now expressed along the lag with ? ? ?0L . Here L ? ?0 t1 ? t0 is interpreted as the lag period over which an exposure to x is assumed to affect the risk at time t usually with ?0 0. This parameterization offers the advantage that the function w is now directly defined in the new dimension of lag ? and it is independent of the time axis chosen for t which may represent different time scales depending on the study design. The function w(?) termed from here on as the lag response function models the lag response curve associated with exposure x. Finally for computational purposes the integral is approximated in (1c) by a sum of terms derived by partitioning the lag interval in equally spaced discrete units and assuming the protracted exposure as a sequence of exposure events xt ? ? at lags ? ?0 L. A statistical model for (1) can be defined by expressing the lag response function w(?) as a linear combination of terms obtained through basis transformation with related parameters. By using matrix notation let the vector qxt of exposure history be defined by (2) Such exposure history changes along time depending on the time t at which the vector qxt is computed. Given (2) the cumulative function s(xt) in (1) can be written using a compact and general matrix notation as (3) The (L ? ?0 1) Ã v? matrix C is obtained from the transformation of the lag vector ? ?0 ? L T by choosing a specific basis with dimension v? for w(?) which defines the related basis functions. In this parameterization the function s(xt) representing the integral of x w(?) over the interval ?0L is defined as a lag basis function with parameters ?. Interestingly the equation in (3) is almost identical to that defining DLMs 24 Eq. (4). The different indexing in the original version reflects the specific application in time series where the data are perfectly ordered in time and the matrix Q has a structure such that qt? ? qt 1? 1. However this is a specific case of the general representation in (2) (3). The theory and software already developed for DLMs can be therefore extended in parallel. Alternative lag basis functions for representing s(xt) are derived through different lag response functions w(?) in (1). In particular the traditional index of unweighted cumulative exposure is a specific case of (3) where reduces to with w(?) equal to a constant c. This is obtained by specifying C as an (L ? ?0 1)-dimensional vector of 1's with v? 1.\nLabels: [Thyroid_Cancer, Colon_Cancer, Lung_Cancer]\nReply with one label only.", "assistant": "Lung_Cancer"}

{"system": "You are a medical text classifier. Choose exactly one label.", "user": "Text: The direct dose mapping (DDM) and energy mass transfer mapping (EMT) are two essential algorithms for accumulating the dose from different anatomic phases to the reference phase when there is an motion or tumor tissue deformation during the delivery of radiation therapy. DDM is based on interpolation of the dose values from one dose grid to another and thus lacks rigor in defining the dose when there are multiple dose values mapped to one dose voxel in the reference phase due to tissue tumor deformation. On the other hand EMT counts the total energy and mass transferred to each voxel in the reference phase and calculates the dose by dividing the energy by mass. Therefore it is based on fundamentally sound physics principles. In this study we implemented the two algorithms and integrated them within the Eclipse TPS. We then compared the clinical dosimetric difference between the two algorithms for 10 lung cancer patients receiving stereotactic radiosurgery treatment by accumulating the delivered dose to the end-of-exhale (EE) phase. Specifically the respiratory period was divided into 10 phases and the dose to each phase was calculated and mapped to the EE phase and then accumulated. The displacement vector field (DVF) generated by Demons-based registration of the source and reference images was used to transfer the dose and energy. The DDM and EMT algorithms produced noticeably different cumulative dose in the regions with sharp mass density variations and or high dose gradients. For the PTV and ITV minimum dose the difference was up to 11 and 4 respectively. This suggests that DDM might not be adequate for obtaining an accurate dose distribution of the cumulative plan instead EMT should be considered.

Background Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) is an important approach to the analysis of coordinate expression changes at a pathway level. Although many statistical and computational methods have been proposed for GSEA the issue of a concordant integrative GSEA of multiple expression data sets has not been well addressed. Among different related data sets collected for the same or similar study purposes it is important to identify pathways or gene sets with concordant enrichment. Methods We categorize the underlying true states of differential expression into three representative categories: no change positive change and negative change. Due to data noise what we observe from experiments may not indicate the underlying truth. Although these categories are not observed in practice they can be considered in a mixture model framework. Then we define the mathematical concept of concordant gene set enrichment and calculate its related probability based on a three-component multivariate normal mixture model. The related false discovery rate can be calculated and used to rank different gene sets. Results We used three published lung cancer microarray gene expression data sets to illustrate our proposed method. One analysis based on the first two data sets was conducted to compare our result with a previous published result based on a GSEA conducted separately for each individual data set. This comparison illustrates the advantage of our proposed concordant integrative gene set enrichment analysis. Then with a relatively new and larger pathway collection we used our method to conduct an integrative analysis of the first two data sets and also all three data sets. Both results showed that many gene sets could be identified with low false discovery rates. A consistency between both results was also observed. A further exploration based on the KEGG cancer pathway collection showed that a majority of these pathways could be identified by our proposed method. Conclusions This study illustrates that we can improve detection power and discovery consistency through a concordant integrative analysis of multiple large-scale two-sample gene expression data sets. issue-copyright-statement BioMed Central Ltd 2014 Background The recent large-scale technologies like microarrays 1 3 and RNA-seq 4 5 allow us to collect genome-wide expression profiles for biomedical studies. Genes showing significant differential expression are potentially important biomarkers 6 . Furthermore a gene set enrichment analysis enables us to identify groups of genes (e.g. pathways) showing coordinate differential expression 7 8 . For some disease studies multiple gene expression data sets have been collected and the related integrative analysis of multiple data sets has been investigated 9 . Since microarray and sequencing based genome-wide expression data sets have been increasingly collected it is necessary to further develop the computational and statistical methods for integrative data analysis studies. Genes and gene sets showing consistent behavior among multiple related studies can be of great biological interest. However since the sample sizes are usually small but the numbers of genes are large it is difficult to identify truly differentially expressed genes and determine whether a gene or a gene set behaves concordantly among different related studies. Although the integrative analysis of multiple gene expression data sets has been well studied in recent years 10 11 the genome-wide concordance has not been well considered. Misleading results may be generated if the concordance among different data sets is not considered in an integrative analysis. Our purpose is to identify pathways or gene sets with concordant enrichment. Recently there are several methods published for meta gene set enrichment analysis of expression data 12 13 . However these methods have not been specifically developed for our study purpose. Statistically we need analysis methods that are consistent with the study purpose. There is still a lack of methods and software for the concordant integrative gene set enrichment analysis. For a gene set enrichment analysis an enriched gene set in one data set may also be enriched in another data set. However this gene set is not necessarily concordantly enriched in both data sets. For an illustration let us consider a simple artificial example: gene set S contains five genes with the first three genes strongly up-regulated in the first data set (the last two genes non-differentially expressed) and the last three genes strongly up-regulated in the second data set (the first two genes non-differentially expressed). Then in general gene set S is enriched in up-regulated differential expression in both data sets. However there is only one gene up-regulated in both data sets; the remaining genes are showing inconsistent behavior. Therefore unless the proportions of differentially expressed genes are small there is a lack of evidence to conclude that gene set S is concordantly enriched in both data sets. Since a gene set concordantly enriched in several similar studies may be of great importance it is necessary to develop statistical methods for detecting these gene sets. It has been shown that a mixture model based approach can be an efficient approach to the differential expression analysis 14 . Furthermore Lung_Cancer we have also demonstrated the usefulness of mixture models in concordant analysis of differential expression among large-scale expression data sets 15 16 . The advantage of the mixture model based approach is that the probability of a particular behavior (up-regulated or down-regulated) can be modeled and estimated for a given gene. Thus it is feasible to address how likely this gene shows a concordant behavior. In this study we develop a mixture model based method for a concordant integrative gene set enrichment analysis. Methods Concordant gene set enrichment In this study we consider multiple large-scale two-sample gene expression data sets. We use K to denote the number of these data sets and m to denote the number of common genes in these data sets. For each of these data sets we usually use a t-type test to evaluate the differential expression of each gene and a gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) method to evaluate the enrichment level of a given gene set. In order to define and evaluate a concordant gene set enrichment when an integrative analysis is conducted for all K data sets we categorize differential expression in each data set into three underlying (unobserved) representative categories: no change positive change (or up-regulated differential expression) and negative change (or down-regulated differential expression). Due to data noise what we observe from experiments may not indicate the underlying truth. (For example a gene with slight down-regulated differential expression may show a small positive t-type test value.) Although these categories are not observed in practice they can be considered in a mixture model framework. To understand the concept of concordant gene set enrichment let us consider an artificial example. Given a pathway with 30 genes we know all the underlying behavior of these genes: 20 genes have positive changes consistently among all different data sets. Furthermore if we randomly select 30 genes we also know that the expected number of genes with consistent positive changes among different data sets is just 5. In this case we would conclude that the given gene set is concordantly enriched in up-regulated differential expression (because 30 is clearly larger than 5). However in practice all the underlying differential expression categories are not observed. Instead they can be considered in a mixture model framework. Then we need to develop a mathematical formula for the probability of concordant enrichment score (CES) of a given gene set S that contains mS genes: which can be useful for prioritizing different gene sets in practice. Before we derive the mathematical formula for the above probability we need to explain the term enriched. As suggested by Efron and Tibshirani 17 unless the test statistic for a gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) considers the genome-wide background patterns (e.g. the statistics proposed in the original GSEA 7 8 ) it is necessary to consider the row randomization for genes in addition to the column permutation for samples. Therefore the term enriched means higher better than expected. Although many test statistics have been developed for GSEA with one large-scale expression data set we still need to develop a new approach for this study. The motivation is: we need to address the component information of the genes in a gene set. The component information is whether a gene is up-regulated down-regulated or non-differentially expressed. Most existing test statistics for the gene set enrichment analysis are either nonparametric or functions of z-score. But it is difficult to analyze the component information with these test statistics. Therefore based on the above discussion for the term enriched we propose the following probability for measuring concordant gene set enrichment: For a gene in a given gene set S an event of interest can be: (1) the gene is concordantly up-regulated; (2) the gene is concordantly down-regulated; or (3) the gene is concordantly differentially expressed (either up-regulated or down-regulated). Our analysis methods for these different types of enrichment analysis are almost mathematically identical. For a mathematical notation of the above CES we denote Ui the indicator that the i-th gene in gene set S satisfies the event of interest. Let D be the observed data and ? be the probability of event of interest if the gene is randomly sampled. Then we have In order to calculate CES practically we propose a three-component multivariate mixture model. In the model each component is a normal distribution. The model configuration for these three components is consistent with the differential expression categories as described above. This model is conceptually analog to a simple normal mixture approach to differential expression analysis proposed by McLachlan et al. 14 . The special feature of our model is that we focus on some specific combination of components from different dimensions. A bivariate version of this model has been used by us to evaluate the concordance and discordance between two large-scale experiments with two sample groups 15 and to integrate two microarray data sets in differential expression analysis 16 . Before the model description we need to describe the related data preprocessing and differential expression test scores as follows. Data preprocessing Because our proposed statistical method is developed based on the differential expression test scores we assume that the given gene expression data sets have been preprocessed appropriately 18 . For a concordant integrative analysis of multiple data sets we also need to select genes shared commonly by different data sets. This can be achieved using the genes' unique identifiers. Differential expression test scores For each of the two-sample gene expression data sets we screen individual genes with the traditional two-sample Student's t-test. Several modified t-tests such as SAM t-test 19 and the moderated t-test 20 have been widely used in the differential expression analysis of microarray data. These test statistics can generally improve the control of false positives by softly filtering out genes with relatively small expression variance. However we intend to consider all the genes equally important in the concordant integrative analysis of multiple data sets. Furthermore a given gene can show different levels of variance in different data sets which may make it difficult to use these modified t-tests. Therefore we still recommend the traditional two-sample t-test as the differential expression test statistic. (In practice other test statistics like SAM t-test or the moderated t-test can still be considered when there is a strong reason to do so.) Because the sample size of a high-throughput study is usually not large it is generally difficult to validate the normal distribution assumptions for the t-test. Therefore instead of the theoretical t-distribution we use the permutation procedure to compute the p-value of an observed t-test 21 . This approach has been widely adopted in the analysis of gene expression data 6 . For K two-sample gene expression data sets with m common genes we compute the one-sided upper-tailed p-value pik for gene Xi in the k-th data set i 12 . . . m and k 12 . . . K. Then we perform an inverse normal transformation to obtain a z-score: zik ?-1(1 - pik) where ?( ) is the cumulative distribution function (c.d.f.) of the standard normal distribution. This transformation has been widely used to improve the fitting of a mixture model 14 . Our proposed statistical methods for the concordant integrative analyses of multiple data sets are developed based on these sets of z-scores. A mixture model For each individual data set we assume that a mixture of three normal distributions can well fit the z-scores. Let denote the probability density function (p.d.f.) of a normal distribution with mean µ and variance ?2. Three representative components are considered for the k-th data set (k 12 . . . K): for genes non-differentially expressed (no change) for genes with up-regulated differential expression (positive change) and for genes with down-regulated differential expression (negative change). Notice that µ0k 0 and (a z-score under the null hypothesis follows the standard normal distribution because its associated p-value follows a standard uniform distribution). This configuration has been suggested in the analysis of gene expression data 14 although more components can be considered to improve the data fitting. Mathematically we have the following density function: which is a type of well-known simple normal mixture model. When the above simple model is extended to accommodate the analysis of multiple data sets we need to consider the combination of components from different dimensions (data sets). Then there are 3K different combinations. We assume that different data sets are collected independently. For the i-th gene with a list of z-scores from different data sets if we know all the related component information then the join density of these z-scores is the product of marginal densities of individual z-scores. Therefore the following formula defines our basic mixture model for a concordant analysis:1 where is the probability for this gene being in a particular combination of different components (j1 j2 . . . jK) in different data sets . We call this model a partial concordance discordance (PCD) model. Notice that a bivariate version of this model has been used to evaluate the overall concordance or discordance of two large-scale data sets and to conduct an integrative analysis of differential expression for two large-scale two-sample data sets 15 16 . Model estimation Our mixture model can be estimated by the well-developed E-M algorithm 22 . In the model the differential expression categories are considered as missing information. For any z-score vector (zi1 zi2 . . . ziK) i 12 . . . m this information can be mathematically represented as if each zik is sampled from the jk-th component (jk 0 1 or 2 and k 12 . . . K) or zero otherwise. With only the observed data the likelihood can be calculated by the following formula: where ? represents the parameter space described previously. The complete likelihood based on the observed data and missing information can be calculated by the following formula: Then we can derive the following E-step formula: We can also derive the following M-step formulas: In the E-M algorithm we iterate E-step and M-step until a numerical convergence of likelihood (not the complete likelihood). Let L(t) and L(t 1) be the likelihood values calculated after the t-th and (t 1)-th iterations respectively. A numerical convergence is claimed if L(t 1) ? L(t) 0.001. Concordant enrichment score Suppose that we are interested in gene sets with coordinate up-regulated differential expression (the CES formulas for the other events of interest can be derived similarly). Then we need to focus on the combination of different components with (j1 1 j2 1 . . . jK 1). Based on the mixture model we can derive the following probability for a gene XSi in a given gene set S XSi : i 12 . . . mS : This probability uSi can be estimated as by plugging-in the estimated parameters in the PCD model. Let hSi be either 0 or 1. Under the assumption that z-scores zik : i 12 . . . m from different genes are independent in each data set k k 12 . . . K we can calculate the concordant enrichment score (CES) for a gene set S XSi : i 12 . . . mS :2 which is the PCD model based estimate for the probability Pr(gene set S is concordantly enriched observed z-score matrix of gene set S). In the formula I(true statement) 1 and I(false statement) 0 (indicator function). Notice that the formula can be simplified to a well-known binomial tail probability if all are the same. However are usually different in practice.\nLabels: [Thyroid_Cancer, Colon_Cancer, Lung_Cancer]\nReply with one label only.", "assistant": "Lung_Cancer"}
{"system": "You are a medical text classifier. Choose exactly one label.", "user": "Text: Twenty-one days after cell sorting peptide specificity was assessed using the IFN-? ELISPOT assay (Fig. 3B). The established clone reacted to the T2 cells pulsed with peptide A but not to T2 cells pulsed with the irrelevant HIV-gag peptide. These results indicate that a peptide A-specific CTL clone was successfully established from PBMCs from a healthy donor. The EML4-ALK-specific CTL clone recognizes HLA-A 02:01 lung carcinoma cells with the EML4-ALK variant 3a b incubated with IFN-? We next evaluated the ability of the EML4-ALK-specific CTL clone to recognize the cancer cell line H2228 which expresses HLA-A 02:01 and EML4-ALK using the IFN-? ELISPOT assay. Even though the EML4-ALK-specific CTL clone failed to recognize H2228 cells it did recognize those pretreated with 100 U ml IFN-? 48 h prior to examination (Fig. 4A). We examined the effect of IFN-? on H2228 cells. Incubating target cells with IFN-? for 48 h increased the expression of MHC class I molecules on the cell surface (Fig. 4B). This result indicates that the peptide A-specific CTL clone was able to recognize H2228 cells because of increased expression of MHC-class I on the H2228 cell surface. Specific IFN-? production by the peptide A-specific CTL clone was detectable in H2228 cells treated with IFN-?. The specificity was abolished by an anti-HLA-class I mAb but not by an isotype control suggesting that the observed production was HLA-A2 restricted (Fig. 4C). A cytotoxicity assay was also performed. The peptide A-specific CTL clone was able to specifically lyse H2228 cells pretreated with IFN-? 48 h prior to examination. This specific lysis was blocked by the anti-HLA-class I mAb but not by the isotype control. These results indicate that the peptide A-specific CTL clone showed cytotoxicity and the ability to produce IFN-? against HLA-A 02:01 EML4-ALK NSCLC cell lines (Fig. 5). Discussion In the present study we identified a new tumor-associated CTL epitope (peptide A) derived from EML4-ALK which binds to HLA-A 02:01 molecules and we were able to establish a peptide-specific CTL clone from human PBMCs that specifically recognized cognate peptide-pulsed T2 cells and HLA-A 02:01 tumor cells expressing EML4-ALK that had been pretreated with IFN-?. EML4-ALK-positive lung cancers are highly sensitive to ALK inhibition. However as with trastuzumab or gefitinib (3031) patients typically gain resistance within 1 to 2 years of starting therapy (23). We aimed to overcome these difficulties with immunotherapy. We identified a glypican-3 (GPC3)-derived peptide and showed that GPC3-specific CTL frequency after vaccination correlated with OS. OS was significantly longer in patients with high GPC3-specific CTL frequencies than in those with low frequencies (32). This indicates that the ability to induce a peptide-specific CTL clone is important for effective immunotherapy. We also revealed that GPC3 is an ideal target for anticancer immunotherapy since it is specifically overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (33 35). In the present study we chose a peptide array from EML4-ALK from which we were able to induce a peptide-specific CTL clone. EML4-ALK is a strong oncogene overexpressed in cancer cells of NSCLC breast cancer kidney cancer and colon cancer (17). We performed RT-PCR and assayed the EML4 DNA levels of certain lung cancer cell lines. H2228 cells express EML4 moderately but at higher levels than other lung cancer cell lines. EML4 expression has been reported as highly expressed in CD8 T cells. RT-PCR showed that EML4 DNA levels were high in PBMCs and CD8 T cells. Because of a lack of suitable antibodies we could not perform western blotting. However our success at inducing a peptide A-specific CTL clone from CD8 T cells indicated that the CTL clone had no cytotoxicity against CD8 T cells. This CTL clone could not recognize cancer cell lines without the ability to increase the amount of HLA class I presented on cell surfaces. Further examination is needed to achieve higher tumor reactivity. Combination chemotherapy or radiation therapy plus immunotherapy was recently reported to have a synergistic effect (36). Moreover some mechanisms of synergy between radiation therapy chemotherapy and immunotherapy have been revealed (37). In one of the mechanisms these therapies upregulated tumor antigens and MHC moieties. These results suggest that combination therapy could be used to make tumor cell lines more susceptible to this peptide A-specific CTL clone-mediated cytolysis (38 41). In addition this treatment may be able to overcome resistance to ALK inhibition. Some resistance mechanisms for targeting drugs have been examined. The most commonly identified causes of resistance are point mutations such as L1196M (42 44) G1269A (22) and S1206Y (21).\nLabels: [Thyroid_Cancer, Colon_Cancer, Lung_Cancer]\nReply with one label only.", "assistant": "Lung_Cancer"}

Interaction of CR1 SNP with smoking Cigarette smoking is a well-known risk for lung cancer so stratification by smoking status was performed to investigate the association of rs7525160 G? ?C variant with the risk of NSCLC. As shown in the risk of NSCLC was associated with the rs7525160 C allele carriers in smokers with OR (95 CI) of 1.72 (1.15-2.59) but not in non-smokers with OR (95 CI) of 1.15 (0.81-1.65) suggesting that the CR1 rs7525160 G? ?C polymorphism is a smoking-modifying risk factor for susceptibility to NSCLC. When the interaction between smoking status and rs7525160 G? ?C variant was analyzed with cumulative smoking dose (pack-year) consistently GC or CC genotype carriers have increased risk of NSCLC among heavy smokers (pack-year???25) with OR (95 CI) of 2.01 (1.26-3.20) but not among light smokers (pack-year 25) with OR (95 CI) of 1.32 (0.81-2.16). The P value for heterogeneity of the stratification analysis by smoking status is 0.015. However the P value for interaction between rs7525160 polymorphism and smoking is 0.172 and the power for the interaction is 0.49. Discussion The chronic airway inflammation and dysfunctional immune system might promote pulmonary carcinogenesis. Implicated in the immune and inflammatory responses the complement cascade plays a pivotal role in the development of cancer. Thus it is likely that the genetic variants of CR1 in the complement system confer the susceptibility to lung cancer. In this study we have for the first time demonstrated that one intronic SNP (rs7525160 G? ?C) out of 13 tag SNPs of CR1 was associated with the risk of NSCLC in Chinese population. Notably the rs7525160 CC genotype was associated with an increased risk of developing NSCLC (OR? ?1.52 95 CI? ?1.02-2.28; P? ?0.028) compared with the GG genotype. MDR analysis also showed that there was no gene-gene interaction among 12 tag SNPs in CR1 gene. Moreover the risk of NSCLC was associated with the rs7525160 C allele carriers in smokers with OR (95 CI) of 1.72 (1.15-2.59) but not in non-smokers with OR (95 CI) of 1.15 (0.81-1.65) indicating this SNP is a smoking-modifying risk factor for susceptibility to NSCLC. To the best of our knowledge this study shed new insight into the interplay of genetic variation of CR1 with lung cancer risk. More importantly it highlights the potential gene-environmental interaction influences the susceptibility to lung cancer. The complement system has been proposed to get involved in innate immunity with the ability to complement antibody-mediated elimination of immune complex and foreign pathogens 26 . Upon complement activation the biologically active peptides C5a and C3a elicit a lot of pro-inflammatory effects and could be closely associated with tumorigenesis 27 . Complement proteins play a dual role in the tumor microenvironment. On one hand they exert a defensive effect against tumor through complement or antibody-dependent cytotoxicity 128 . On the other hand they may escape from immunosurveillance and facilitate carcinogenesis 2 . Specifically a number of experimental evidence has suggested an association between complement activation and tumor growth 2930 which provides a strong biologically link between the abnormal expression and activity of complement cascade and carcinogenesis. Till now a few studies have been carried out to demonstrate the association of genetic variants in complement proteins with susceptibility to cancer. A significant association of CR2 SNP (rs3813946) with the development of nasopharyngeal carcinoma was indicated in Cantonese population 31 and the genetic variations of complement system genes C5 and C9 plays a potential role in susceptibility to non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) 32 . Recently it has been shown that complement factor H Y402H polymorphism interact with cigarette smoking to confer the susceptibility to lung cancer 33 . Furthermore it has been indicated that CR1 A3650G (His1208Arg) polymorphism plays a critical role in conferring genetic susceptibility to gallbladder cancer in north Indian population 19 . However whether the genetic variants of CR1 are related to the risk of lung cancer remains unknown. In this case-control study we found an intronic SNP (rs7525160 G? ?C) with CC genotype was significantly associated with an increased risk of NSCLC. Consistently our results were in accordance with the study that genetic polymorphisms in innate immunity genes may play a role in the carcinogenesis of lung cancer 34 . It is likely that some genetic variations in strong link disequilibrium with this intronic SNP (rs7525160 G? ?C) are functional which provides a new insight into the hallmarks in susceptibility to lung cancer and further functional experiments are warranted to address the proposal. Functionally human CR1 exists on the surface of almost all peripheral blood cells and plays a key role in immune complex clearance and complement inhibition at the cell surface by binding to activated products C3b and C4b 435 . CR1 also possesses cofactor activity for the serum protease factor I and is thus involved in the generation of further fragments of C3 4b with the activation of complement cascade and the cellular immune response 4 . In our study the association of CR1 polymorphism with lung cancer is biologically plausible in that the intronic polymorphism could affect the density of CR1 molecules on the cell surface thereby contributing to autoimmune disorders and neoplasm. Tobacco smoking is an established risk factor for susceptibility to lung cancer. However not all people who suffer from lung cancer are smokers. Lung cancer in non-smokers can be induced by second hand smoke air pollutants and diesel exhaust 36-39 . Our present data showed significant difference of pack-year smoked but not smoking status between NSCLC cases and controls which suggested the important role of other environmental factors in the development of NSCLC. Tobacco could induce chronic and sustained inflammation in lung microenvironment contributing to pulmonary carcinogenesis in smokers 40 . Support also comes from the epidemiologic data regarding inflammation and lung cancer 41 . CR1 an important molecule implicated in immunity and inflammation could protect the host from invasion of exogenous chemicals derived from cigarette smoking. Genetic variant of CR1 could alter gene function and result in deregulation of the inflammatory and immune responses thereby modulating the susceptibility to lung cancer. More importantly we observed a potential interaction of this SNP (rs7525160 G? ?C) with smoking status suggesting the gene-environmental interaction plays a prominent role in the susceptibility to lung cancer. Our present study has its limitation. Our patients may not be representative of total NSCLC patients at large because they were recruited from only one hospital. In addition due to the relatively small sample size further case-control studies are still needed to replicate and extend our findings. Conclusion We conducted a case-control study in Chinese subjects and found an intronic SNP (rs7525160 G? ?C) of CR1 was significantly associated with lung cancer risk. To the best of our knowledge this study provides the first evidence that genetic variant of CR1 (rs7525160 G? ?C) was a smoking-modifying contributor to the development of lung cancer. Methods Study subjects This case-control study consisted of 470 patients with histopathologically confirmed NSCLC and 470 cancer-free controls. All subjects were genetic unrelated ethnic Han Chinese. Patients were recruited between January 2008 and December 2012 at Tangshan Gongren Hospital (Tangshan China). There were no age gender or stage restrictions however patients with previous malignancy or metastasized cancer from other organs were excluded. The response rate for patients was 94 . The controls were randomly selected from a pool of a cancer-free population from a nutritional survey conducted in the same region. The selection criteria for control subjects included: i) no individual history of cancer; ii) frequency matched to cases according to gender age ( 5 years); iii) the residential region; and iv) the time period for blood sample collection. At recruitment informed consent was obtained from each subject and each participant was then interviewed to collect detailed information on demographic characteristics. This study was approved by the institutional review board of Hebei United University. Tag SNPs selection and genotyping Based on the Chinese population data from HapMap database we used Haploview 4.2 program to select candidate tag SNPs with an r2 threshold of 0.80 and minor allele frequency (MAF) greater than 1 . Furthermore we also added two potential functional polymorphisms rs9429942 and rs6691117 4243 . Therefore we included 13 SNPs in our study which represents common genetic variants in Chinese population. Genotyping was performed at Bomiao Tech (Beijing China) using iPlex Gold Genotyping Asssy and Sequenom MassArray (Sequenom San Diego CA USA). Sequenom s MassArray Designer was used to design PCR and extension primers for each SNP. Primer information for selected tag SNPs was listed in Table 5.

Sum of the SUVmax of the 5 most hypermetabolic lesions (2 lung lesions 2 mediastinal lymph nodes one liver lesion) were 45.6 19.7 (?56.7 ) and 12.7 (?72 ) for PET1 PET2 ( versus PET1) and PET3 ( versus PET1) respectively. Based on a SUVmax cut-off value of ?21.6 the patient was classified as mNP on PET2 in accordance with RECIST evaluation on CT scan (performed 58 days after starting erlotinib). mNP was confirmed on PET3 with almost complete extinction of the various lesions and a 72 decrease of SUVmax. .0087629.g005 Example of left lower lobe pulmonary target lesion (same patient as ). .0087629.g006 Example of a patient with discordant PET2 and conventional imaging. Patient with right upper lobe NSCLC associated with subcarinal lymphadenopathy and ipsilateral lung metastasis (patient 9). Sum of the SUVmax of the most hypermetabolic lesions (2 lung lesions 1 mediastinal lymph node) were 25.2 29.3 ( 16.3 ) and 23.8 (?5.4 ) for PET1 PET2 ( versus PET1) and PET3 ( versus PET1) respectively. Based on a SUVmax cut-off value of ?21.6 the patient was classified as mP on PET2 in contrast with RECIST evaluation on CT scan (performed 71 days after starting erlotinib). This patient was subsequently reclassified as mNP on PET3 in accordance with RECIST evaluation with a 5.4 decrease of SUVmax (cut-off: 18.5 ). In 9 10 patients semi-quantitative analysis on PET3 revealed response information concordant with PET2 studies. ROC analyses were also performed for SUV changes between PET1 and PET3. For SUVmax sensitivity specificity PPV NPV and accuracy were 0.810.83 1 and 0.9 respectively for an ?18.5 cut-off value and an AUC of 0.76 (95 CI; 0.44 to 1.08; P? ?0.17). For SUVpeak sensitivity specificity PPV NPV and accuracy were 10.81 0.83 and 0.9 respectively for a ?3.9 cut-off value with an AUC of 0.8 (95 CI; 0.5108 to 1.089; P? ?0.12). Patients were classified identically with SUVmax and SUVpeak (4 with true progressive disease 5 with true non-progressive disease and one with false non-progressive disease). Due to the appearance of new lesions on PET the patient 7 who was falsely classified as NP by semi-quantitative analysis of PET was correctly reclassified as P. Finally PET3 correctly classified all 10 patients (5 in group P; 5 in group NP) in whom a third 18F FDG-PET was performed when compared with RECIST evaluation (P? ?.0079 Fisher's exact test). Patient outcome PFS and OS were 91 and 338 days respectively. Using the SUVmax or SUVpeak cut-off defined by ROC analyses on PET2 patients were classified into 2 groups: metabolic progressive (n? ?8; mP) or metabolic non-progressive (n? ?4; mNP). mNP patients showed prolonged PFS (n? ?4; median survival 292 days) compared to mP patients (n? ?8; median 64 days) (HR 0.27; 95 CI 0.04 to 0.59; P? ?0.007; ). Improved PFS observed in mNP patients was followed by prolonged OS (1031 days versus 1249 days; HR 0.34; 95 CI 0.06 to 0.84; P? ?0.03; ). The first patient with EGFR mutation showed a PFS and OS of only 190 days and 296 days respectively due to erlotinib toxicity (grade IV neurotoxicity) resulting in early discontinuation of treatment. The second patient with EGFR mutation achieved the longest PFS and OS (727 and 1249 days respectively). .0087629.g007 Kaplan-Meier estimates of PFS and OS. No statistically significant difference (P? ?0.007) in PFS was observed between metabolic non-progressive (mNP) patients (median PFS 292 days ; range 190 727) and metabolic (mP) progressive patients (median PFS 64 days ; range: 37 216). Improved PFS in non-progressive patients was associated with prolonged OS (mNP; n? ?4; median OS: 1031 days ; 296 to 1249 days versus mP; n? ?8 ; 337 5 days ; 71 to 734 days) (HR 0.34; 95 CI 0.06 to 0.84; P? ?0.03). Discussion Despite the widespread use of 18F FDG-PET CT in NSCLC staging a large-scale study recently failed to confirm an overall survival gain in NSCLC patients. 17 This result highlights the value of 18F FDG-PET CT in unmet clinical needs such as prediction of residual NSCLC after surgery 18 neoadjuvant therapy 19 or antineoplastic therapy. 20 Prediction of response to antineoplastic therapies would appear to be particularly adapted to targeted therapies that do not induce rapid tumor shrinkage. NSCLC preclinical models have validated this hypothesis with both gefitinib 21 and erlotinib. 22 This original method could compensate for the weakness of RECIST criteria and has led to the proposal of evaluation of new criteria by addition metabolic evaluation by FDG-PET to CT scan. 23 The value of PET in evaluation of response to new targeted therapies emerged in the early 2000 s with the first reports on the efficacy of imatinib mesylate in Gastro Intestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST). Subsequently many studies have confirmed that PET is able to identify very early (i.e. only 24 hours after initiation of treatment) a decrease in glucose metabolism which is correlated with overall survival and progression-free survival of patients with GIST. 24 25 In the present exploratory study a decrease in SUVmax of at least 21.6 soon after starting therapy (9 3 days) was able to discriminate progressive from non-progressive patients and was associated with improved PFS and OS. This result confirms the results of Mileshkin et al. who showed in a series of 51 patients receiving second- or third-line treatment with erlotinib that an early (14 days) 18F FDG-PET partial metabolic response was associated with improved PFS and OS even in the absence of subsequent RECIST response. 26 Evaluation of response by 18F FDG-PET can be performed semi-quantitatively for instance by establishing a SUV cut-off to discriminate metabolic progressive patients from non-metabolic progressive patients. This patient classification (mP mNP) seems to be more appropriate to assess response to cytostatic therapy that is designed to stabilize disease rather than achieve complete response. The main difficulty of this approach is the overlap of SUV changes between mP and mNP patients. Furthermore different cut-off variations can be expected depending on the types of SUV measured the types of drugs used and the types of tumors which increase the difficulty of establishing a reliable SUV cut-off. However despite the absence of consensus on the most appropriate cut-off value it is generally admitted that the rationale for metabolic response or non-progression of tumor is decreased 18F FDG tumor uptake or at least stability of tumor uptake over time respectively. Another limitation of semi-quantitative analysis of FDG-PET is that it does not take into account the development of new lesions. However PET detection of new lesions early in the course of therapy has been reported to be a strong independent predictive factor of OS in NSCLC patients treated by EGFR inhibitor. 27 Our findings are consistent with this observation as new lesions occurred in 2 8 patients correctly classified as progressive on PET2 and in 4 5 patients correctly classified as progressive on PET3. One patient (patient 7) was reclassified as mP on PET3 due to the appearance of a new lesion despite a decrease of SUVmax to below the cut-off value. As in our study previous studies failed to demonstrate any difference between SUVmax and SUVpeak. 22 28 However SUVmax remains the standard for semi-quantitative 18F FDG-PET assessment probably because is a parameter that can be reliably reproduced by independent operators. It is noteworthy that in our study no significant difference in mean SUV values was observed between PET1 PET2 and PET3 which can be explained by the nature of the cytostatic therapy. 11 12 patients were correctly classified (P versus NP) by PET2 and 10 10 were correctly classified by PET3 by applying the SUV cut-off determined by ROC analysis. In 9 10 patients PET3 revealed response information concordant with PET2. The only patient with discordant 18F FDG-PET findings was classified by SUV analysis as progressive on PET2 and non-progressive on PET3. Blood glucose injected dose or uptake time were normal and or not significantly different between PET2 and PET3 (1.16 and 1.4 g l; 261 and 262 MBq; 60 and 75 min respectively) excluding any to methodology-related error. A flare-up phenomenon could be proposed as described on several occasions on 18F FDG-PET during cytotoxic treatments for squamous cell carcinoma in prostate cancer patients with bone metastases 29 33 and particularly NSCLC patients treated with erlotinib presenting an osteoblastic bone flare-up response mimicking disease progression. 34 Benz et al also described a case of flare-up on early PET in a NSCLC patient treated by erlotinib. 27 Another explanation is that the P NP classification probably increases mismatches of response assessments related to a discordant outcome of patients with stable disease. 27 Our results suggest that therapeutic efficacy PFS and OS of erlotinib therapy can be predicted 2 weeks after starting erlotinib. These data are consistent with the data of a retrospective study recently published by Kobe et al. 26 35 At the present time anticancer therapy is currently monitored in the context of hormone-sensitive cancers by regular assay of tumor markers (such as prostate-specific antigen in prostate cancer). The efficacy of hormonal therapy is reflected by a decrease in blood levels of the marker. When the marker remains elevated hormonal therapy is considered to be ineffective and is therefore stopped. Repeated PET imaging can be considered to be a promising approach to evaluate cancer therapy such as targeted therapies that do not induce tumor shrinkage. This new approach appears to be supported by the results of recent clinical trials. The Tarceva Versus Docetaxel or Pemetrexed for Second Line Chemotherapy of Advanced Stage NSCLC (TITAN) trial failed to demonstrate an improvement in OS with erlotinib compared to chemotherapy in unselected NSCLC patients receiving second-line treatment (HR? ?0.96; 95 CI 0.78 1.19; p? ?0.73). 36 In a similar group of NSCLC patients the results of the TAILOR trial indicated a highly significant increase of PFS in favor of docetaxel (HR? ?0.71; 95 CI 0.53 0.95; p? ?0.02) versus erlotinib. 37 We consider that evaluation of the metabolic response to erlotinib could provide useful information to rapidly identify patients in whom erlotinib therapy is ineffective especially in EGFR patients without EGFR-activating mutations or unknown status. 18F FDG-PET could also become a theranostic tool for clinicians. By stopping ineffective therapy earlier physicians can rapidly propose other drugs to a larger proportion of patients with better performance status. This approach could increase the number of patients included in early trials and accelerate drug development. However no medico-economic study has been conducted to determine whether the additional costs induced by 18F FDG-PET are compensated by the decreased costs of drug (erlotinib) and medical care induced by side effects. Our study highlights the need for more prospective and randomized studies to evaluate the theranostic use of 18F FDG-PET for management of erlotinib therapy in NSCLC including medico-economic considerations.\nLabels: [Thyroid_Cancer, Colon_Cancer, Lung_Cancer]\nReply with one label only.", "assistant": "Lung_Cancer"}

Background Although dendritic cell (DC) vaccines are considered to be promising treatments for advanced cancer their production and administration is costly and labor-intensive. We developed a novel immunotherapeutic agent that links a single-chain antibody variable fragment (scFv) targeting mesothelin (MSLN) which is overexpressed on ovarian cancer and mesothelioma cells to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) which is a potent immune activator that stimulates monocytes and DCs enhances DC aggregation and maturation and improves cross-priming of T cells mediated by DCs. Methods Binding of this fusion protein with MSLN on the surface of tumor cells was measured by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. The therapeutic efficacy of this fusion protein was evaluated in syngeneic and orthotopic mouse models of papillary ovarian cancer and malignant mesothelioma. Mice received 4 intraperitoneal (i.p.) treatments with experimental or control proteins post i.p. injection of tumor cells. Ascites-free and overall survival time was measured. For the investigation of anti-tumor T-cell responses a time-matched study was performed. Splenocytes were stimulated with peptides and IFN?- or Granzyme B- generating CD3 CD8 T cells were detected by flow cytometry. To examine the role of CD8 T cells in the antitumor effect we performed in vivo CD8 cell depletion. We further determined if the fusion protein increases DC maturation and improves antigen presentation as well as cross-presentation by DCs. Results We demonstrated in vitro that the scFvMTBHsp70 fusion protein bound to the tumor cells used in this study through the interaction of scFv with MSLN on the surface of these cells and induced maturation of bone marrow-derived DCs. Use of this bifunctional fusion protein in both mouse models significantly enhanced survival and slowed tumor growth while augmenting tumor-specific CD8 T-cell dependent immune responses. We also demonstrated in vitro and in vivo that the fusion protein enhanced antigen presentation and cross-presentation by targeting tumor antigens towards DCs. Conclusions This new cancer immunotherapy has the potential to be cost-effective and broadly applicable to tumors that overexpress mesothelin. Mycobacterial Hsp70 Mesothelin Single chain variable fragment Cancer immunotherapy Murine tumor model Background The goal of cancer immunotherapy is to stimulate the immune system to destroy cancer cells. Numerous strategies that involve tumor antigen-specific and non-specific activation of the immune system have been developed. These include dendritic cell (DC) vaccines adoptive T-cell therapy and immune checkpoint blockade 1-3 . Antigen-specific active immunotherapy is expected to be the most attractive strategy because of its capacity to induce both therapeutic and protective T-cell immunity. Among various approaches DC vaccine is considered to be a promising treatment for advanced cancer based on the ability of DCs to orchestrate all of the elements of the immune system. DCs capture tumor antigens process these antigens into peptides as they move to the draining secondary lymphoid ans and present the peptides to na ve T cells thus inducing anti-tumor cellular immune responses. DCs can also activate B cells NK cells and NKT cells 1 . In pre-clinical and clinical studies that exploited DCs as a means to improve vaccine efficiency autologous DCs are loaded ex vivo with antigens and re-administered to the patient. For example Sipuleucel-T (Provenge) that consists of ex vivo activated autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) including antigen-presenting cells (APCs) has resulted in a significant survival benefit in Phase III trials for prostate cancer 4 .\nLabels: [Thyroid_Cancer, Colon_Cancer, Lung_Cancer]\nReply with one label only.", "assistant": "Lung_Cancer"}
{"system": "You are a medical text classifier. Choose exactly one label.", "user": "Text: These observations clearly demonstrate that acetylation of peptide's N-terminus is an efficient way to reduce the nonspecific kidney accumulation and optimize the in vivo kinetics of peptide-based imaging probes. To our surprise the apparent stability profile of all three divalent probes (64Cu-(M10)2 64Cu-D10 and 64Cu-AcD10) measured in rat serum out to 24 h were almost identical. This indicates that the in vivo properties of the divalent probe were improved as the result of its positive charge reduction. However we cannot rule out the possibility that acetylation improves the in vivo stability in mice. It is important to note that the previous PET studies with A20FMDV2 also used a capped N-terminus and the kidney uptake varied greatly. Similarly the ?v?6-binding cysteine knot probes showed persistent kidney retention. Therefore simple capping of the N-terminus does not abrogate kidney retention for all ?v?6 PET probes. Additionally it should be noted that multimerization of other peptidic ligands has also lead to a significant increase in kidney accumulation 30 48. Kidney retention of peptidic probes is a complicated multifactorial issue and involves numerous factors including peptide stability charge hydrophobicity choice of radiolabel peptide sequence and chemical modifications of the peptide 50-52. Due to their size peptides are filtered by glomeruli and excreted; however a small percentage of the peptide or peptide fragments are reabsorbed by the proximal tubules and retained. Although unlikely to induce substantial renal toxicity within the context of imaging retention of the radiolabel can affect detection of tumors within or around the kidneys. However kidney accumulation can be problematic for therapeutic applications in which the peptide is used to deliver radiopharmaceuticals or chemotherapeutics. As such efforts to reduce peptidic retention in the kidneys is of key importance. Minor changes in the charge and or chemical structure of a peptide have been shown to dramatically affect renal uptake. Pre-dosing animals with polycationic species or Gelofusine prior to administering radiolabeled peptides has been observed to reduce kidney retention. PEGylation of peptides has also been shown to improve tumor-to-kidney uptake ratio. Although we have shown significant reduction of kidney retention by acetylating the peptide we are performing further empirical studies to minimize kidney accumulation of the radiolabeled peptidic probes. Integrins are commonly found in tumor cells as well as in angiogenic tumor vasculature. As previously mentioned the H2009.1-10mer peptide sequence contains an RGD moiety which is an overlapping ligand for various integrins such as ?v?3 integrin. Although in vitro data support the specificity of the H2009-10mer peptide for ?v?6 one may question whether our imaging results indeed reflect the ?v?6 expression in tumor. To answer this question we performed an imaging study in the same tumor models using our recently reported conjugate (64Cu-CB-TE2A-(c(RGDyK))2) built on the same BFCS which specifically targets the ?v?3 integrin. The cRGDyX peptide is widely used as an ?v?3-specific ligand for both molecular imaging of angiogenic tumor vasculature and anti-angiogenic therapies 53. Unlike H2009.1-10mer conjugates the 64Cu-CB-TE2A-(c(RGDyK))2 showed virtually identical uptake in H2009 and H460 tumors out to 24 h p.i. (1.8 ID g at 1h p.i.; 0.7 ID g at 24 h p.i.). Lack of specificity of 64Cu-CB-TE2A-(c(RGDyK))2 can be attributed to ubiquitous expression of ?v?3 integrin in angiogenic vessels as well as in tumor cells. Unlike 64Cu-CB-TE2A-(c(RGDyK))2 the specific imaging of H2009 tumor by 64Cu-(M10)2 64Cu-D10 or 64Cu-AcD10 is primarily due to the restrictive expression of ?v?6 integrin in H2009 tumor. These results clearly demonstrate the potential use of our designed probes for molecular profiling of ?v?6 NSCLC. Conclusions Imparting multivalency is an effective way to improve biopotency of a phage selected peptide. The designed multivalent probes showed enhanced binding affinity which was utilized for PET signal enhancement in ?v?6 tumor imaging. Significantly multivalent probes maintained the desired specificity to image ?v?6 H2009 tumor while low signal was observed in ?v?6- H460 tumor. We showed that N-terminus acetylated probe (64Cu- AcD10) provided drastic uptake reduction in kidney and other non-target ans while maintaining tumor uptake. Further evaluation of this methodology is under way to realize its full potential in imaging probe design by utilizing existing ligands selected from combinatorial library screening. Overall the selective tumor uptake of 64Cu-AcD10 along with its favorable distribution in major ans makes it an ideal candidate to be developed for specific imaging of ?v?6 expression. Additionally 67Cu can be used for radiotherapy opening the possibility of using this probe as a therapeutic as well.

PAX6 is frequently expressed in retinoblastoma pancreatic tumors and intestinal tumors 6 10 11 . PAX6 is also highly expressed in brain and breast cancer cell lines 9 . In pancreatic carcinoma cell lines the inhibition of PAX6 expression leads to a decrease in cell growth and survival 12 . PAX6 is also a regulator of MET tyrosine kinase receptor expression in pancreatic carcinoma cell lines 12 . MET is a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for tumors which confirms the oncogenic role of PAX6 in tumorigenesis 13 . It was previously reported that PAX8 and PAX5 are highly expressed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer cell lines respectively 14 ; but little is known regarding PAX6 expression and function in lung cancer. In this study we investigated whether PAX6 regulated cell proliferation of NSCLC. Our findings show that PAX6 promotes G1-S progression by activating the MAPK signal pathway. PAX6 mRNA was frequently expressed in lung cancer tissue as compared to corresponding adjacent non-neoplastic tissue. This suggests that PAX6 is a new potential target in lung cancer. Materials and Methods RPMI 1640 fetal bovine serum (FBS) and Trizol Reagent were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad CA); M-MLV reverse transcription CellTiter 96 aqueous non-radioactive cell proliferation assay oligo-dT and dNTP were obtained from Promega (Madison WI); SYBR Green PCR Master Mixture was from Applied Biosystems (Carlsbad CA); anti-PAX6 antibodies were purchased from Abnova (Taibei Taiwan) anti-pRB -ERK1 2 p38 -pERK -pp38 -cyclin D1 and -pRB (S780 phosphorylation) antibodies were obtained from Abcam (Cambridge England UK); and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagent was obtained from Pierce (Rockford IL). Propidium iodide (PI) RNase A and protease inhibitor cocktail were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis MO). Samples Fifty-two NSCLC specimens were obtained from patients undergoing surgical resection at Beijing Chest Hospital. Primary lung cancer samples and matched adjacent normal tissues were used. The study and use of specimens was reviewed and approved by Research Ethic Committee in Beijing Chest Hospital Capital Medical University (Beijing China).

Cell culture Human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines A549 and NCI-H1299 human large cell lung carcinoma cell lines NCI-H460 small cell lung cancer cell line NCI-H446 human embryo lung fibroblasts (MRC-5) were obtained from the National Platform of Experimental Cell Resources Sci-Tech. Human large cell lung carcinoma cell lines 95C 95D and 801D were obtained from the tumor center of Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. Human lung adenocarcinoma cell line A2 and squamous cell carcinoma cell line L were isolated and established by our lab. The lung cancer cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen Carlsbad CA USA) supplemented with 10 fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco Los Angeles CA USA). MRC-5 were maintained in MEM-EBSS supplemented with 10 FBS. Construction of a PAX6 shRNA lentiviral vector and infection into cells Four RNA interference (RNAi) candidate target sequences were designed based on the human pax6 mRNA sequence and cloned into the pGCSIL-GFP vector (GeneChem Shanghai China). The RNAi sequence GAGTAGCGACTCCAGAAGT was the most effective at suppressing PAX6 mRNA in H1299 and A549 cells and was used in subsequent experiments to knock down endogenous PAX6. Nonsilencing (NS)-small interfering RNA (shRNA) (TTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT) was also cloned into the pGCSIL-GFP vector and used as a control (GeneChem). The recombinant virus was packaged in 293T cells using a Lentivector Expression System (GeneChem). For cellular infection H1299 and A549 cells were subcultured at 5000 cells well in 96-well culture plates and infected with lentivirus-mediated pax6-shRNA or NS-shRNA. The GFP expression level was detected via fluorescence microscopy (Nikon Tokyo Japan) to determine the infection efficiency. RNA isolation and real-time PCR Total RNA from tissue and cells was isolated with Trizol Reagent according to the manufacturer s protocol. The total RNA concentration was calculated by measuring the OD260 and the samples were stored at 80 C. Total RNA (2 µg) was reverse-transcribed using an M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase Kit according to the manufacturer s protocol. The cDNA (20 ng) was mixed with SYBR Green Master Mix and genes were amplified with appropriate primers using a real-time PCR detection system (ABI7500; Life Technologies Carlsbad CA). The relative expression levels of PAX6 mRNA were calculated by normalization to the ?-actin mRNA level. The PCR primers used were as follows: PAX6 forward 5'-TTCAGCACCAGTGTCTACCA-3'; PAX6 reverse 5'-GCTGTAGGTGTTTGTGAGGG-3'; ?-actin forward 5'-TTAGTTGCGTTACACCCTTTC-3'; and ?-actin reverse 5'-GCTGTCACCTTCACCGTTC - 3'. Cell proliferation assay A proliferation assay was carried out using Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay according to the manufacturer s protocol. Briefly5000 cells well were seeded into 96-well culture plates in RPMI 1640 containing 10 FBS. The cells were cultured for 5 days then 20 µL of 3-(45-dimethyl-thiazol-2yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2- (4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) was added to each well and the cells were incubated at 37 C for 3 h every 24 h. The absorbance was recorded at 490 nm with a universal microplate reader (Bio-Rad Hercules CA).\nLabels: [Thyroid_Cancer, Colon_Cancer, Lung_Cancer]\nReply with one label only.", "assistant": "Lung_Cancer"}
{"system": "You are a medical text classifier. Choose exactly one label.", "user": "Text: Materials and Methods We examined the anti-tumor effect of Ad-REIC on 25 NSCLC cell lines in vitro and A549 cells in vivo. Two of these cell lines were artificially established as EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) resistant sublines. Results Ad-REIC-treatment inhibited the cell viability by 40 or more in 13 (52 ) of the 25 cell lines at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 20 (20 MOI). These cell lines were regarded as being highly sensitive cells. The cell viability of a non-malignant immortalized cell line OUMS-24 was not inhibited at 200 MOI of Ad-REIC. The effects of Ad-REIC on EGFR-TKI resistant sublines were equivalent to those in the parental cell lines. Here we demonstrated that Ad-REIC treatment activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in NSCLC cell lines indicating the induction of ER stress with GRP78 BiP (GRP78) up-regulation and resulting in apoptosis. A single intratumoral injection of Ad-REIC significantly inhibited the tumorigenic growth of A549 cells in vivo. As predictive factors of sensitivity for Ad-REIC treatment in NSCLC we examined the expression status of GRP78 and coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR). We found that the combination of the GRP78 and CAR expressional statuses may be used as a predictive factor for Ad-REIC sensitivity in NSCLC cells. Conclusion Ad-REIC induced JNK activation and subsequent apoptosis in NSCLC cells. Our study indicated that Ad-REIC has therapeutic potential against NSCLC and that the expression statuses of GRP78 and CAR may predict a potential therapeutic benefit of Ad-REIC. No current funding sources for this study. Introduction Lung cancer is the most common cause of death from cancer worldwide and the metastatic form is a major factor leading to mortality 1 . There are two major histological subtypes of lung cancer: non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer. Recent intensive studies have identified causative molecular alterations that have directly led to the development of new therapeutic strategies and have improved patient prognosis 2 . For example mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor gene (EGFR) are found in approximately 30 of NSCLCs especially in lung adenocarcinomas and EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are particularly effective in these tumors 3 4 . More recently crizotinib has been shown to be effective for NSCLCs with an EML4-ALK fusion gene 5 6 . However the number of patients with these alterations is limited and little improvement in prognosis has been obtained in NSCLCs without these drug-sensitive alterations. Furthermore acquired resistance eventually occurs in the majority of EGFR-mutant tumors which had previously responded to EGFR-TKI after an average of 10 months of treatment 7 . Thus a new therapeutic modality is needed to improve the clinical outcome of patients with lung cancer. REIC Dkk-3 a member of the Dickkopf (Dkk) gene family is originally found in immortalized cells and has been reported to be a tumor suppressor; its expression is significantly down-regulated in a broad range of cancer cell types including lung cancer 8 . The heatmap image of messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of REIC Dkk-3 gene from the UCSC Cancer Genome Browse which is freely available public database (: genome-cancer.ucsc.edu ) (we downloaded the data on July 16 2013) showed that REIC Dkk-3 gene expression was reduced in majority of examined samples of both lung adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas compared with normal lung tissues (Figure S1). In addition it could be confirmed from a public database that expression of REIC Dkk-3 was also low in many NSCLC cell lines (Gene Expression Omnibus repository http: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov geo GEO accession GSE4824 ). REIC Dkk-3 is known to interfere with Wnt signaling via Wnt receptors 9 10 and was previously reported to play a distinct role in the induction of apoptosis and the inhibition of metastasis 11 12 . The induction of apoptosis in cancer cells is mainly caused by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress induced by the overproduction of REIC Dkk-3 in the cells. ER stress triggers the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) which is a critical event in apoptosis induced by the overproduction of REIC Dkk-3 using an adenovirus vector (Ad-REIC) 11 13 . In our previous studies we found that Ad-REIC had a therapeutic effect on various types of human cancer including the prostate testis pleura and breast carcinomas 11 13 15 . Ad-REIC infection and REIC Dkk-3 protein are also known to up-regulate the anti-tumor immunosystem 16 . Based on preclinical data a clinical trial using Ad-REIC for human prostate cancer has been ongoing in Japan and the USA (NCT01197209). In this study we investigated the therapeutic effect of Ad-REIC on NSCLC cells in vitro and in vivo. We also examined factors related to the sensitivity of cell lines to Ad-REIC as a step toward the development of customized Ad-REIC therapy for patients with NSCLC. Materials and Methods Ethics Statement This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The protocol was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Okayama University (Permit Number: OKU-2012-549).

Adenovirus vector carrying REIC Dkk-3 REIC Dkk-3 was overexpressed using an adenovirus (Ad-REIC) that we have previously generated 11 . A full-length cDNA of REIC Dkk-3 was integrated into a cosmid vector pAxCAwt and transferred into an adenovirus vector by the COS-TPC method (Takara Bio Shiga Japan). An adenovirus vector carrying LacZ gene (Ad-LacZ) was also used as control 11 . Cell viability assay Cells were plated in 96-well plates at a density of 1.5Ã 103 cells well at 48 h after infection with Ad-LacZ or Ad-REIC at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 20100 or 200 MOI. Cell viability was evaluated 3 days later using an MTS assay with CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution Reagent (Promega Madison WI). Apoptosis assay To examine the in vitro induction of apoptosis after treatment we seeded the cells in 6-well plates and incubated them for 24 h. The cells were treated with Ad-LacZ or Ad-REIC at 20 MOI in serum-free medium (500 µL) for 2 h; the medium was then exchanged for fresh complete medium (2 mL). After an additional 48 h of incubation Hoechst 33342 dye (Sigma-Aldrich St. Louis MO) was added to the medium at a concentration of 2 µg mL and the cells were incubated in the dark for 10 min. Hoechst 33342 is an intercalating dye that allows the determination of variations in the total chromatin quantity and the degree of chromatin condensation 15 . Using fluorescence microscopy we identified apoptotic cells by the presence of highly condensed or fragmented nuclei. Apoptotic cells were counted in 5 different fields under microscopic observation. Western blot analysis The detailed protocol for the Western blot analysis is described in Method S1. It was performed under conventional conditions using the following antibodies: rabbit anti-human REIC Dkk-3 antibody raised in our laboratory 11 ; rabbit anti-human GRP78 BiP (GRP78) (ab21685; Abcam Cambridge MA); rabbit anti-human SAPK JNK ( 9252) and rabbit anti-human phospho-SAPK JNK (Thr183 Tyr185; 9251) (Cell Signaling Technology Beverly MA); rabbit anti-human coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) (HPA030411; Atlas antibodies Stockholm Sweden); and mouse anti-actin (MAB1501; Millipore Billerica MA). The following secondary antibodies were used: goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Santa Cruz CA). To detect the specific signals the membranes were examined using ECL plus Western Blotting Detection Reagents (Amersham Biosciences UK Limited Buckinghamshire UK). In addition the band intensities for GRP78 CAR and actin representing their expression levels were measured using ImageQuant TL software (GE Healthcare Bioscience) and quantified by GRP78 or CAR actin ratio. Tumor growth assay in vivo A549 cells (5Ã 106 in 50 µL of phosphate buffered saline PBS ) mixed with 50 µL of Matrigel (BD Biosciences San Jose CA) were subcutaneously injected into the right flank of adult female BALB c nu nu mice (CLEA Japan Tokyo Japan). The tumor volume was calculated using the empirical formula V? ?1 2Ã (the shortest diameter)2Ã (the longest diameter) . When the tumors had reached approximately 50 100 mm3 mice (n? ?15) were randomly divided into 3 treatment groups: (a) PBS; (b) Ad-LacZ; and (c) Ad-REIC. Viruses (1Ã 109 pfu) in 100 µL of serum-free medium were administered intratumorally. At the end of experiments mice were sacrificed after 24-days after the viral injection and tumors were harvested measured and photographed. Statistical analyses All data were analyzed using STATA ver.12 (STATA Corp. College Station TX). Fisher's exact test was applied when appropriate. For a comparison of induction of apoptosis between Ad-REIC-treated and Ad-LacZ-treated A549 cells a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel statistics was applied for comparing. Repeated measurement ANOVA was applied for the comparison of xenotransplanted NSCLC tumor sizes among PBS Ad-LacZ and Ad-REIC. P 0.05 was considered significant. All tests were two-sided. Results Effect of Ad-REIC on NSCLC cell lines We examined the inhibition of cell viability using Ad-REIC and an MTS assay. In 13 (52 ) of 25 NSCLC cell lines Ad-REIC treatment at 20 MOI inhibited the cell viability (40 60 inhibition) compared with Ad-LacZ treatment ( Figure 1). These cell lines were regarded as highly sensitive to Ad-REIC. In contrast 12 cell lines (48 ) were not inhibited by Ad-REIC treatment at 20 MOI and were regarded as resistant cells. OUMS-24 was not inhibited at 20 or 200 MOI of Ad-REIC. Of note Ad-REIC treatment at 100 and 200 MOI improved the inhibition of cell viability (100 MOI: 15 59 inhibition 200 MOI: 40 78 inhibition) compared with Ad-LacZ treatment (). Thus we defined 20 MOI as a low MOI value and 200 MOI as a high MOI value. For comparison Ad-REIC treatment was also performed in the human mesothelioma cell line 211H which we previously reported to be Ad-REIC-sensitive 14 . The 211H was not inhibited at 20 MOI but was inhibited at 200 MOI of Ad-REIC (). The known molecular characteristics of each cell line are shown in . The 25 NSCLC cell lines consisted of 8 EGFR-mutant 6 KRAS-mutant 1 HER4-mutant 1 NRAS-mutant 1 PIK3CA-mutant 1 EML4-ALK fusion 1 HER2-amplified and 6 cell lines without gene alterations listed. Nine of the 17 EGFR-wild type cell lines were sensitive to Ad-REIC. HCC827 and its resistant subline HCC827-GR-high2 showed a similar degree of sensitivity to Ad-REIC. No trend in molecular genotype was seen between the sensitive and non-sensitive cell lines. These results suggested that the effect of Ad-REIC does not depend on a known molecular genotype. .0087900.g001 Figure 1 Sensitivity and predictive factors of sensitivity for Ad-REIC treatment in 25 NSCLC cell lines. The inhibition rates of 25 NSCLC cell lines transfected with Ad-REIC compared to Ad-LacZ are shown as black bar in 20 MOI and white bar in 200 MOI. Thirteen cell lines with over 40 inhibition rate in 20 MOI are defined as highly sensitive and 12 cell lines with lower inhibition rate in 20 MOI are defined as resistant. All the resistant cell lines shows over 40 inhibition rate in 200 MOI. The cell lines are classified into 3 categories based on the GRP and CAR protein expression level as follows; category A (low GRP high CAR) category B (low GRP low CAR or high GRP high CAR) category C (high GRP low CAR). All 8 highly sensitive cell lines were included in category A and all 5 resistant cell lines were included in category C. Sq; squamous cell carcinoma AD; adenocarcinoma LC; large cell carcinoma ADSQ; adenosquamous cell carcinoma MM; malignant mesothelioma NHF; normal human fibroblast. Hoechst 33342 staining was performed in A549 cells to examine the induction of apoptosis. Apoptotic cells were observed in Ad-REIC-treated A549 cells (Figure 2a). The mean rate of apoptosis was 22 and it was significantly (p 0.001 by Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test) increased in comparison with the control Ad-LacZ treatment. .0087900.g002 Figure 2 Ad-REIC induced JNK activation and subsequent apoptosis in NSCLC cells. (a) Induction of apoptosis after in vitro Ad-REIC treatment as examined in A549 cells using Hoechst 33342 staining. The upper panel indicates the appearance of apoptotic cells after Ad-REIC treatment. The lower panel shows the apoptotic rate of A549 cells after the indicated treatment. A total of 5 different fields were examined under a microscope to determine the apoptotic rate. A significant difference was observed ( p 0.001) between the Ad-LacZ and the Ad-REIC treatment. (bar: 100 µm) (b) Western blot analysis for proteins involved in signal transduction triggered by Ad-REIC. Cells were harvested at 48 h after transfection with Ad-LacZ or Ad-REIC at 20 MOI. (c) H460 cells which are resistant to adenovirus transduction were harvested at 48 h after transfection with Ad-LacZ or Ad-REIC at 20100 and 200 MOI. The effect of recombinant REIC Dkk-3 protein on NSCLC cell lines was examined in 7 randomly selected cell lines (NCI-H522 NCI-H611 NCI-H1299 NCI-H1819 NCI-H2009 PC-9 and A549). The MTS assay showed that REIC Dkk-3 protein did not affect cell viability in the examined cell lines when administered at a concentration ranging from 1 to 200 µg mL (data not shown). Expression of GRP78 and CAR in response to Ad-REIC therapy As predictive factors of Ad-REIC sensitivity in NSCLC we examined the expressions of GRP78 and CAR; these expression statuses were correlated with the inhibition of cell viability by Ad-REIC in 13 cell lines. A previous study reported that the overexpression of GRP78 inhibited ER-stress which may be oppositely correlated with the effect of Ad-REIC. CAR expression is tightly associated with the efficacy of adenovirus infection which may be positively correlated with the effect of Ad-REIC. Western blotting was performed and the expression level was quantified as shown in and Figure 1. The median (range) of GRP78 and CAR expressions were 0.24 (0.075 0.98) and 0.60 (0.080 2.1) respectively. Based on these data cells with a GRP78 expression level more than 0.25 were defined as High CRP78 expression while those with a GRP78 less than 0.24 were defined as Low GRP78 expression. Regarding the CAR 15 cell lines significantly high level of CAR expression (over 0.50) were defined as High CAR expression while 10 cell lines those with significantly low level of CAR expression (under 0.20) were defined as Low CAR expression. GRP78 expression was low in 8 of the 13 Ad-REIC-sensitive cells (62 ) and in 4 of the 12 Ad-REIC-resistant cells (33 ). CAR expression was high in 12 of the 13 Ad-REIC-sensitive cells (92 ) and in 3 of the 12 Ad-REIC-resistant cells (25 ). Next we classified the cell lines into three categories based on the GRP78 and CAR expression statuses; cells with a Low GRP78 High CAR expression were classified as Category A those with Low GRP78 Low CAR or High GRP78 High CAR expression were classified as Category B and those with High GRP78 Low CAR expression were classified as Category C. The high sensitive cell rates were 100 in Category A (8 out of 8 95 confidence interval CI : 63 100) 42 in Category B (5 out of 12 95 CI: 15 72) and 0 in Category C (0 out of 5 95 CI: 0 52) (Table 2). The categories were significantly associated with the sensitivity to Ad-REIC treatment (p 0.01). .0087900.t002 Table 2 Ad-REIC sensitivity and categories based on predictive factors. (n) Category A (8) Category B (12) Category C (5) Highly sensitive (13) 8 5 0 Resistant in 20 MOI (12) 0 7 5 JNK and GRP78 expression in NSCLC cell lines treated with Ad-REIC A western blotting analysis demonstrated the significant expression of REIC Dkk-3 protein in 14 NSCLC cell lines treated with Ad-REIC. In 9 cell lines infected with 20 MOI Ad-REIC treatment resulted in the phosphorylation of JNK and the up-regulation of GRP78 (Figure 2b). In the other 8 cell lines which were relatively resistant to Ad-REIC the activation of JNK and GRP78 were observed at higher MOI values (100 and 200 MOI) (Figure 2c). Effect of Ad-REIC on NSCLC tumors in a xenotransplantation model We investigated the effect of Ad-REIC on the growth of A549 cells in vivo. One week after transplantation when the tumor volume reached 50 to 100 mm3 1Ã 109 plaque-forming units of Ad-REIC or Ad-LacZ in 100 µL of PBS or 100 µL of PBS alone were injected intratumorally. The tumors grew progressively in the PBS and Ad-LacZ treatment groups during the subsequent 24-day observation period. In contrast the tumor growth in the Ad-REIC treatment group was significantly (p 0.001 by repeated measurement ANOVA) suppressed during the observation period (Figure 3ab). .0087900.g003 Figure 3 Anti-tumor effect of Ad-REIC treatment on A549 tumor growth in vivo. (a) The mean volume of the subcutaneous xenograft tumors was calculated for 5 mice in each group. A significant difference was observed between the results of Ad-REIC and Ad-LacZ treatment ( p 0.001 by repeated measurement of ANOVA). (b) Appearance of the tumors at the time of sacrifice after treatment with PBS Ad-LacZ and Ad-REIC. Discussion In the present study we found that Ad-REIC was directly effective in more than half of the NSCLC cell lines that were examined independent of its known driver alterations such as EGFR and KRAS mutations. An animal xenograft model also showed the therapeutic effect of Ad-REIC. The anti-tumor effect of Ad-REIC depends on ER-stress-mediated JNK activation loaded by the overproduction of REIC Dkk-3 protein resulting in the induction of apoptosis 14 20 . The activation of JNK which is an essential step in the induction of ER stress and apoptosis by Ad-REIC was observed at 20 MOI in NSCLC cell lines. On the other hand the anti-tumor effect of recombinant REIC Dkk-3 protein was not observed as in other types of cancers that were previously examined. Originally REIC Dkk-3 was identified as a secretory protein and was assumed to exert a physiological function but its cell surface receptor and its role as a secretory protein have not been identified. We defined 20 MOI as a low MOI value and 200 MOI as a high MOI value because the normal human fibroblast cell line OUMS-24 was not inhibited at 20 or 200 MOI of Ad-REIC whereas malignant cell lines were inhibited when the MOI value was elevated to 100 and 200 MOI in cell lines in which Ad-REIC had been ineffective at 20 MOI. In NSCLC Ad-REIC was effective at a low MOI value in more than half of the cell lines that were tested. Considering the result that 211H was inhibited only at a high MOI value Ad-REIC might be more effective in NSCLC than in mesothelioma. Patient selection based on the molecular characteristics of tumor cells is an important theme for maximizing the therapeutic benefit and minimizing adverse effects. For this purpose we focused on the GRP78 expression and CAR expression levels. GRP78 is a member of the Hsp70 family which serves as an ER stress-signaling regulator 21 . A previous study showed that the overexpression of GRP78 conferred resistance to a wide variety of chemotherapeutic agents in various kinds of cells 22 . We also showed that the acquired resistance clone of PC-3 cells to Ad-REIC established after repeated exposure to Ad-REIC exhibited a high expression level of GRP78 compared with parental PC-3 cells 13 . Theoretically Ad-REIC should be effective for tumor cells defined as Category A and not as effective for those defined as Category C. Although sensitive cells in Category B were identified all 8 cells in Category A responded to Ad-REIC treatment. These results suggested that the expression statuses of GRP78 and CAR in tumors might be useful as biomarkers for customized Ad-REIC therapy in NSCLC while further confirmation is needed by a large scaled investigation using various kinds of cell lines. As a recent topic of lung cancer treatment EGFR-TKIs have been shown to be effective for the treatment of EGFR-mutant NSCLCs. However acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs after TKI treatment is a problem that needs to be overcome. In the current study our results showed that the effect of Ad-REIC against acquired EGFR-TKI-resistant cells was equal to that against the parental cells suggesting that Ad-REIC may be useful after the acquisition of resistance to EGFR-TKIs. Although adenovirus vectors carrying appropriate tumor suppressor genes such as REIC Dkk-3 have great potential for cancer gene therapy they do not exhibit target specificity and therefore may also infect normal cells in the vicinity of cancer cells. The authors reported that the infection of normal human fibroblasts (NHF) with Ad-REIC did not cause the apoptosis of NHF itself but instead induced the production of interleukin (IL)-7. When Ad-REIC-infected NHF were mixed with untreated cancer cells and the mixture was transplanted into mice the growth of the cancer cells was significantly suppressed suggesting an indirect tumor-suppressive effect of Ad-REIC mediated by IL-7 20 . These findings show that the mis-targeted infection of cancer stroma cells by Ad-REIC activates the immune system through the production of IL-7. In addition the authors reported that REIC Dkk-3 protein played a cytokine-like role in monocyte differentiation into dendritic-cell-like features in vitro and that the infiltration of CD11c- and CD8-positive (dendritic and killer T cell markers respectively) cells was observed within the treated tumors in vivo. In the experiment using an orthotopic prostate tumor model with pre-established lung metastasis the number of metastatic lung tumors significantly decreased after the injection of Ad-REIC at the primary tumor site in addition to the inhibition of the growth of orthotopic prostate tumors suggesting that anti-cancer immune up-regulation by Ad-REIC treatment in primary tumor sites triggered anti-tumor effects even at distant tumor site 16 . These facts strongly suggest that REIC Dkk-3 shows an indirect anti-tumor effect through the anti-tumor immune system that is an important factor in the treatment of metastatic disease. Because Ad-REIC has both direct and indirect effects on cancer therapy it may become a powerful therapeutic option as a one-bullet two-arms anti-cancer agent especially for NSCLCs which often metastasize to other organs. In regards to clinical usage because our data suggest that CAR and GRP78 expression statuses in tumor cells predict the responsiveness of Ad-REIC treatment Ad-REIC treatment should be preferentially performed for patients who are categorized as high sensitive group in early phase of treatment with low dose Ad-REIC. For patients whose tumor cells reveal intermediate or poor effectiveness with low dose Ad-REIC it should be late phase in their treatment with high dose Ad-REIC. For these patients cost effectiveness for treatment and clinical outcome should be carefully considered. As for administration strategy local administration might be preferable rather than systemic administration to minimize the adverse effect in clinical situations. We previously confirmed in mouse model that Ad-REIC could be widely distributed in the bodies after intratumoral local administration and local administration was effective not only directly but also indirectly through the immune system effect 16 23 . In addition intrapleural local administration could be another administration strategy for the patients with malignant pleural effusions. It has been reported that the intrapleural administration of adenoviral-mediated gene therapy is a useful approach for the generation of anti-tumor immune responses in malignant mesothelioma and metastatic pleural effusion in several clinical trials 24 25 . In conclusion we demonstrated that Ad-REIC induced JNK activation and subsequent apoptosis in NSCLC cells irrespective of the type of known molecular alterations or the sensitivity to EGFR-TKI. The present study suggests that Ad-REIC has a therapeutic potential for NSCLC and the expression statuses of GRP78 and CAR may be a predictor of Ad-REIC therapy. Supporting Information Figure S1 The heatmap image of mRNA expression of REIC Dkk-3 gene. The mRNA expression level of REIC Dkk-3 gene was obtained from the UCSC Cancer Genome Browse which is freely available public database (: genome-cancer.ucsc.edu ) (we downloaded the data on July 16 2013) showed that REIC Dkk-3 gene expression was reduced in majority of examined samples of both (a) lung adenocarcinomas and (b) squamous cell carcinomas compared with normal lung tissues.

All rights reserved. 2014 AIM To revisit the presumed relationship between tumour diameter and volume in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients and determine whether the measured volume using volume-analysis software and its proportional changes during therapy matches with the calculated volume obtained from the presumed relationship and results in concordant response assessment. MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty-three patients with stage IIIB IV NSCLC with a total of 53 measurable lung lesions treated in a phase II trial of erlotinib were studied with institutional review board approval. Tumour volume and diameter were measured at baseline and at the first follow-up computed tomography (CT) examination using volume-analysis software. Using the measured diameter (2r) and the equation calculated volume was obtained as (4 3) ?r3 at baseline and at the follow-up. Percent volume change was obtained by comparing to baseline for measured and calculated volumes and response assessment was assigned. RESULTS The measured volume was significantly smaller than the calculated volume at baseline (median 11488.9 mm3 versus 17148.6 mm3; p 0.0001) with a concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) of 0.7022. At follow-up the measured volume was once again significantly smaller than the calculated volume (median 6573.5 mm3 versus 9198.1 mm3; p 0.0022) with a CCC of 0.7408. Response assessment by calculated versus measured volume changes had only moderate agreement (weighted ? 0.545) with discordant assessment results in 20 (8 40) of lesions. Calculated volume based on the presumed relationship significantly differed from the measured volume in advanced NSCLC patients with only moderate concordance in response assessment indicating the limitations of presumed relationship.

However the function of p38 activation in tumor metastasis is still not well understood. We report that p38 activation in breast cancer cells inhibits tumor metastasis but does not substantially modulate primary tumor growth. Stable p38 knockdown in breast cancer cells suppressed NF-?B p65 activation inhibiting miR-365 expression and resulting in increased IL-6 secretion. The inhibitory effect of p38 signaling on metastasis was mediated by suppression of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) migration to the primary tumor and sites of metastasis where MSCs can differentiate into cancer-associated fibroblasts to promote tumor metastasis. The migration of MSCs to these sites relies on CXCR4-SDF1 signaling in the tumor microenvironment. Analysis of human primary and metastatic breast cancer tumors showed that p38 activation was inversely associated with IL-6 and vimentin expression. This study suggests that combination analysis of p38 MAPK and IL-6 signaling in patients with breast cancer may improve prognosis and treatment of metastatic breast cancer. p38 MAPK Breast cancer Metastasis microRNA IL-6 J Mol Diagn J Mol Diagn The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics : JMD 1525-1578 1943-7811 American Society for Investigative Pathology 24813172 4078366 S1525-1578(14)00074-9 10.1016 j.jmoldx.2014.03.006 Regular Detection of Gene Rearrangements in Targeted Clinical Next-Generation Sequencing Abel Haley J. ?

The identification of recurrent gene rearrangements in the clinical laboratory is the cornerstone for risk stratification and treatment decisions in many malignant tumors. Studies have reported that targeted next-generation sequencing assays have the potential to identify such rearrangements; however their utility in the clinical laboratory is unknown. We examine the sensitivity and specificity of ALK and KMT2A (MLL) rearrangement detection by next-generation sequencing in the clinical laboratory. We analyzed a series of seven ALK rearranged cancers six KMT2A rearranged leukemias and 77 ALK KMT2A rearrangement negative cancers previously tested by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Rearrangement detection was tested using publicly available software tools including Breakdancer ClusterFAST CREST and Hydra. Using Breakdancer and ClusterFAST we detected ALK rearrangements in seven of seven FISH-positive cases and KMT2A rearrangements in six of six FISH-positive cases. Among the 77 ALK KMT2A FISH-negative cases no false-positive identifications were made by Breakdancer or ClusterFAST. Further we identified one ALK rearranged case with a noncanonical intron 16 breakpoint which is likely to affect its response to targeted inhibitors. We report that clinically relevant chromosomal rearrangements can be detected from targeted gene panel based next-generation sequencing with sensitivity and specificity equivalent to that of FISH while providing finer-scale information and increased efficiency for molecular oncology testing.

Cycle-to-cycle variations in respiratory motion can cause significant geometric and dosimetric errors in the administration of lung cancer radiation therapy. A common limitation of the current strategies for motion management is that they assume a constant reproducible respiratory cycle. In this work we investigate the feasibility of using rapid MRI for providing long-term imaging of the thorax in order to better capture cycle-to-cycle variations. Two nonsmall-cell lung cancer patients were imaged (free-breathing no extrinsic contrast and 1.5?T scanner). A balanced steady-state-free-precession (b-SSFP) sequence was used to acquire cine-2D and cine-3D (4D) images. In the case of Patient 1 (right midlobe lesion 40?mm diameter) tumor motion was well correlated with diaphragmatic motion. In the case of Patient 2 (left upper-lobe lesion 60?mm diameter) tumor motion was poorly correlated with diaphragmatic motion. Furthermore the motion of the tumor centroid was poorly correlated with the motion of individual points on the tumor boundary indicating significant rotation and or deformation. These studies indicate that image quality and acquisition speed of cine-2D MRI were adequate for motion monitoring. However significant improvements are required to achieve comparable speeds for truly 4D MRI. Despite several challenges rapid MRI offers a feasible and attractive tool for noninvasive long-term motion monitoring. 1. Introduction Respiratory motion causes significant uncertainties in tumor delineation radiotherapy (RT) dose calculations and delivery particularly in the case of thoracic tumors (e.g. lung liver) 1 . The management of respiratory motion has been an active area of research over the last decade. Several investigational as well as clinically implemented respiratory motion management strategies have been described in the literature 1 . However a common limitation of most of these strategies is that they rely on image-guidance techniques that make simplifying assumptions about respiratory motion and do not adequately capture cycle-to-cycle variations which invariably occur in all patients. Modern motion-managed radiotherapy typically uses four-dimensional computed tomography (4DCT) as the tool of choice for pretreatment anatomic imaging (also termed as CT simulation or CT-sim in the literature). In this technique CT projections are acquired over several respiratory cycles from successive slabs in the body. At the same time an external surrogate (e.g. an optical marker) records the amplitude of respiration. Based on the surrogate motion trace the reconstructed slices are sorted into 6 10 volumes over a single respiratory average cycle where each volume represents a specific phase of respiration (inhalation through exhalation) 2 4 . This retrospectively reconstructed movie of a single respiratory cycle serves as the anatomical ground truth for all subsequent stages of radiotherapy (contouring treatment planning and dose delivery). It is well recognized however that respiratory motion is far more complex than can be characterized by a single average cycle. Cycle-to-cycle variations such as baseline shifts and changes in the amplitude and or frequency of the respiratory waveform are inadequately accounted for in 4DCT-based planning and can lead to significant geometric and therefore dosimetric errors 5 . Furthermore binning CT projection data acquired over several cycles into a single cycle leads to severe image artifacts. For example Yamamoto et al. found that 45 of 50 patients had at least one artifact with mean magnitude of 11.6?mm (range: 4.4 56.0?mm) 6 . In a separate study Persson et al. found that 4DCT artifacts caused significant uncertainties in the delineation of the gross tumor volume (GTV) in 16 out of 19 patients 7 . Finally the equivalent dose for 4DCT is quite high (29 40?mSv) about 4 times higher than that for 3DCT (3 10?mSv) 8 . Such high imaging dose discourages long-term monitoring and frequent imaging. Due to these limitations 4DCT-based image guidance provides an incomplete picture of respiration-induced spatial and temporal changes in the thoracic anatomy. The aim of this work is to investigate the feasibility of using rapid magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a nonionizing imaging modality to capture long-term and or frequent information about respiratory motion and its effects on the movement and deformation of lung tumors and surrounding critical ans. The fundamental difference and therefore advantage of cine MRI are that unlike 4DCT the MR image (i.e. slice or volume) is acquired prospectively thereby capturing an actual instance of the patient anatomy which is closer to reality compared to an average estimate of the anatomical state that is represented by 4DCT. Prospective acquisition also enables MRI to overcome the two main challenges that limit the utility of 4DCT images namely the ability to capture cycle-to-cycle variations and elimination of binning-related image artifacts. In addition due to the fact that MRI does not involve ionizing radiation there is no dose penalty for repeated imaging (as opposed to 4DCT). The use of rapid cine-2D as well as 4D MRI for radiotherapy guidance has been previously reported in the literature. In cine-2D MRI a slice of the anatomy is selected at arbitrary orientation and imaged repeatedly in time. 4D MRI is conceptually similar except that in this case an entire volume is selected and imaged. Plathow et al. have reported cine-2D imaging of lung cancer patients at 3 frames per second (fps) 9 and 4D imaging of malignant pleural mesothelioma patients at 1 volume s 10 under slow-breathing conditions using a 1.5?T scanner. Von Siebenthal et al. have reported on a 4D MR imaging technique using retrospective stacking of cine-2D slices 11 . Biederer et al. report 4D MRI of a ventilated chest phantom that uses porcine lung with embedded agarose nodules to simulate tumors 12 . More recently Cai et al. have reported a 4D MRI study of a moving phantom using a technique that uses retrospective sorting of cine-2D slices 13 . To our knowledge there has been no systematic study of rapid lung MRI in the context of image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) motion management under realistic (prospective acquisition free-breathing human subjects) conditions. In this work we present a pilot investigation of prospective rapid cine-2D and cine-3D (commonly termed as 4D in radiotherapy and the MRI literature) MRI of two nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients under free-breathing conditions without externally administered contrast. Subsequently we compute and analyze the motion trajectories of tumors and structures of interest. Our current goal is to demonstrate the feasibility and the utility of rapid MR imaging to monitor respiratory motion over multiple cycles and obtain guidance information about the motion deformation and the interplay between lung tumors and surrounding critical ans. Our long-term goal (beyond the current scope) is to use the information obtained from rapid MRI to augment and potentially correct 4DCT images. 2. Methods 2.1. Imaging of NSCLC Patients Two NSCLC patients were imaged following informed consent. Patient number 1 was a 67-year old female with an 40?mm diameter right midlobe tumor. Patient number 2 was an 80-year old male with an 60?mm diameter left upper-lobe tumor. Both patients were scanned on a 1.5?T scanner (GE Signa). Both patients were scanned in the supine position under free-breathing conditions and without externally administered contrast. For each patient a 4-channel cardiac coil was centered around the tumor. cine-2D time series in the coronal and sagittal planes were acquired using a balanced steady-state free precession (b-SSFP) sequence and the images were reconstructed using the vendor's in-built software. In all cases except one (Patient number 1 coronal series) half-Fourier acquisition was used in order to achieve higher imaging speed. In the case of Patient number 2 an additional 3D t (4D) scan of a tumor-inclusive coronal slab (8 slices each 5?mm thick) was acquired using the b-SSFP sequence in the 3D mode and in conjunction with parallel imaging (acceleration 4). The 4D images were reconstructed using the autocalibrating reconstruction for Cartesian imaging (ARC) algorithm 14 . Table 1 summarizes the image acquisition parameters for the cine-2D and the 4D acquisitions. 2.2. Motion Analysis For each time series from Table 1 the motion trajectories of the tumor and structures of interest were determined as follows. A fluid-flow-based deformable image registration previously validated for RT applications 15 17 was applied to each time series to compute deformation vector fields (DVFs) across the temporal dimension. In order to reduce errors and achieve high computation speed (i.e. fewer iterations) the registration was performed in two stages-rigid registration which accounted for gross translation and affine transformations of the tumor and ans followed by deformable registration which accounted mainly for tumor and an deformation. For each time series a reference image was selected (typically at mid-inhale) and 15 points each on the tumor boundary and the diaphragm were manually selected. Subsequently the motion trajectory of each pixel on a contour was determined from the DVFs. The validity of using diaphragmatic motion as a surrogate for tumor motion was examined by calculating the correlation between the average motion trajectory of the pixels comprising the diaphragm boundary with the average trajectory of the pixels comprising the tumor boundary. The presence of complex motion such as tumor rotation and or deformation was tested by comparing the motion trajectory of the tumor centroid with those of the selected points on the tumor boundary. 3. Results and Discussion Figure 1 shows MR images acquired from Patient number 1 (Figures 1(a) and 1(b)) and Patient number 2 (Figures 1(c) and 1(d)). The acquisition times per image ranged from 0.15 to 0.27?s speeds adequate for monitoring most respiratory motion. In each case the tumor mass (indicated by an arrow) can be clearly delineated against the background of lung parenchyma. Figure 2(a) shows a frame from the 4D acquisition from Patient number 2. A surface rendered tumor-inclusive volume-of-interest in four different respiratory phases is shown in Figure 2(b). Both the tumor as well as the surrounding anatomy exhibit significant deformation from phase to phase. Figure 3 shows motion trajectories extracted from two time series one from each patient. MRI-based monitoring over multiple respiratory cycles yields some interesting observations. In the case of Patient number 1 there is little cycle-to-cycle variation in the respiratory pattern as evidenced by the motion trajectory of the diaphragm. Furthermore the motion of the tumor centroid is well correlated with the motion of the diaphragm (Figure 3(a); R2 0.99) indicating that in this case diaphragmatic motion is an appropriate surrogate for tumor motion. Finally the motion of individual points on the tumor boundary (i.e pixels comprising the edges of the tumor mass) is well correlated with that of the tumor centroid (Figure 3(b); R2 0.9 to 1.0) indicating the absence of any significant rotation or deformation in the tumor mass. In the case of Patient number 2 while the respiratory pattern is quite regular (as seen from the motion trajectory of the diaphragm) the motion of the tumor centroid is very poorly correlated with diaphragmatic motion (Figure 3(c); R2 0.16) and shows significant cycle-to-cycle variation. This behavior indicates that in this case diaphragmatic motion is a poor surrogate for tumor motion. Furthermore the motion of the tumor centroid is also relatively poorly correlated with that of individual points on the tumor boundary (Figure 3(d); R2 0.56 to 0.94) indicating the occurrence of significant rotation deformation of the tumor mass. The complex motion observed in Patient number 2 is likely due to the proximity of tumor to the cardiac wall which almost touches the edge of the tumor (Figure 1(c)) and serves as a second actuator of motion (the first being the diaphragm). These results demonstrate that the current clinical practice of using the motion of the diaphragm (or external or internal surrogates for diaphragmatic motion) has significant limitations when the tumor mass is located in the proximity of other moving structures. The goal of this work was to demonstrate the feasibility and the potential advantages of using rapid MRI as a pretreatment image-guidance tool for lung RT. These early results from rapid MRI of NSCLC patients show that for guidance-quality imaging the inherent contrast presented by the tumor mass and critical structures against the signal-poor lung parenchyma enables us to sacrifice SNR in order to achieve adequate acquisition speed to capture respiratory motion. Furthermore in the case of Patient number 2 we observe that through long-term prospective MR imaging one can capture spatiotemporal effects that are not captured by 4DCT. This is due to the fact that 4DCT projections are sorted using an external surrogate for diaphragmatic motion thereby implicitly assuming that a perfect correlation exists between diaphragmatic motion and tumor motion. The choice of a 1.5?T scanner for this work was motivated by the fact that several lung motion investigations have been performed at this field strength 12 18 . Observer studies comparing 1.5?T and 3?T scanners for lung MRI show that there is no significant difference in overall image quality 19 20 suggesting that the expected benefits of higher SNR at 3?T are somewhat mitigated due to the accompanying increase in susceptibility artifacts. Furthermore at this initial stage we chose to use existing coils and sequences. As seen from the results while this strategy was adequate for cine-2D imaging very large improvements in acquisition speed are required for truly 4D MRI. This is evidenced by the fact that even with the use of parallel acceleration 4 the acquisition time for the 4D time series shown in Figure 2 was 1.5?s volume. Thus there is much room for exploration of other rapid MRI sequences and for developing sequences specifically optimized for RT guidance. In particular we expect the largest improvements in imaging speed to come from strategies based on sparse sampling and reconstruction such as k-t Broad-use Linear Acquisition Speed-up Technique (k-t BLAST) and its parallel imaging version k-t SENSitivity Encoding (k-t SENSE). Beyond the current scope it is expected that the information obtained from rapid MRI (cine-2D or 4D) can be merged with that from 3DCT or 4DCT to create a fused pretreatment 4D image that combines the soft-tissue contrast and temporally dense information from MRI with the spatial accuracy and electron density information from CT. Admittedly this is a nontrivial problem because one has to account for MRI artifacts correct for geometric distortions of the anatomy due to the relatively narrow bore of the magnet and develop robust multimodality image registration tools. Furthermore since this was a feasibility study the patients were not asked to lie in the treatment position for the MRI scan. However for future studies which aim to fuse the MRI with CT patients will be required to do so. However if these challenges are addressed fused 4D images would provide a more realistic picture of the behavior of thoracic anatomy over multiple respiratory cycles. Such guidance would enable the development of novel 4D treatment planning paradigms that explicitly account for effects such as baseline shifts and changes in abdominal versus thoracic breathing. Finally several investigators are working on integrated MRI linac designs 21 23 . Online prospective 4D MRI would enable such systems to perform real-time monitoring and potentially real-time beam adaptation. 4. Conclusion We have investigated the feasibility of rapid MRI as a modality for image-based guidance in lung radiotherapy. While the acquisition speeds of cine-2D imaging are adequate for capturing most respiratory motion significant further improvements are required to achieve comparable speeds for truly 4D MRI acquisition. Nevertheless these early results indicate that rapid MRI offers a highly attractive noninvasive imaging tool for respiratory motion management. The ability to perform dose-free long-term monitoring over multiple respiratory cycles yields valuable information that is not currently available with 4DCT. We expect that such image-guidance will lay the groundwork for significantly better respiratory motion management in lung radiotherapy.

Three subsequent doses were administered at 3-day intervals thereafter. For survival studies we observed the mice daily 3 weeks after inoculation of BR5FVB1 cells or 1 week after inoculation of 40L cells. Tumor generations were consistently first evident via abdominal distension secondary to malignant ascites and tumor-bearing mice were euthanized at the endpoint when there were signs of distress including fur ruffling rapid respiratory rate hunched posture reduced activity and progressive ascites formation as previously described 25 . For the investigation of anti-tumor T-cell responses all ovarian tumor-bearing mice were sacrificed 7 days after the final scheduled treatment. All studies were performed in a manner that was blinded to the observer under protocols that were approved by the Massachusetts General Hospital Subcommittee on Research Animal Care (SRAC). Treatment of na ve mice with experimental or control protein 6-week-old male C57BL 6 mice were injected i.p. with scFvMTBHsp70 (2 ?g per mouse) normal saline or an equimolar mixture of MTBHsp70 plus P4 scFv. Three subsequent doses were administered at 3-day intervals thereafter. Seven days post the administration of the final treatment mice were sacrificed and abdominal wall and intestine were retrieved for histopathological studies of mesothelial tissues. Ex vivo assessment of tumor specific T-cell functions Single cell suspensions were prepared from spleens. Cells were plated in round-bottomed 96-well plates pulsed with a validated CD8 T-cell Her2 neu peptide (PDSLRDLSVF 1 ?g ml; EZBiolab) 2543 an in-house designed H2d-restricted MSLN Ld1 peptide (IPLSYLCDF 1 ?g ml; EZBiolab) that did not induce ovarian cancer specific T-cell response in H-2q FVB mice or medium alone for 72 hours when Golgi Plug (BD Bioscience) was added for the last 5 hours as previously described 44 and then stained with fluorophore-conjugated anti-CD3 anti-CD4 anti-CD8 anti-IFN? (BD Pharmingen) and anti-Granzyme B (eBioscience) antibodies. Cells were then analyzed on a LSRII 4 laser (BD Biosciences). Depletion of CD8 T cells in vivo FVB NJ mice were injected i.p. with 200 ?g of anti-CD8 monoclonal antibody (mAb)(53 6.72 Bio X Cell) or an isotype-matched irrelevant rat IgG2a (2A3 Bio X Cell) 2 days before 1 day before and 1 day after i.p. inoculation with BR5FVB1 ovarian tumor cells. Depletion was continued once every week until 29 days after tumor inoculation. The mice were treated with scFvMTBHsp70 or saline as described above. All the mice were bled from the tail vein and the depletion of CD8 cells was examined by flow cytometry analysis of peripheral blood cells stained with fluorophore-conjugated anti-CD8 on days 7 and 28 after tumor inoculation. Generation and purification of bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs) CD11c DCs were generated from bone marrow cells of FVB NJ mice as described 45-47 with minor modifications. Briefly erythrocyte-depleted mouse bone marrow cells from flushed marrow cavities were cultured in complete RPMI 1640 with 10 ng ml GM-CSF and 1 ng ml IL-4 at 1 106 cells ml. Medium was changed on day 3. On day 7 DCs were harvested by gentle pipetting and purified with magnetic microbeads conjugated to a monoclonal antibody against CD11c (MiltenyiBiotec) as described 4648 according to the manufacturer s recommended protocol. In vitro activation of BMDCs CD11c BMDCs were plated in a 24-well plate at a density of 2? ?106 cells ml and incubated with 2 ?g ml scFvMTBHsp70 (105 kDa) 1.3 ?g ml MTBHsp70 (70 kDa) 1 ?g ml LPS equivalent to 103 EU ml endotoxin (InvivoGen San Diego CA) or 0.1 ng ml (0.1 EU ml) LPS equivalent to endotoxin found in 2 ?g ml of proteins (since LPS level is less than 50 EU per mg of protein) for 24 h at 37 C in humidified atmosphere with 5 CO2. Cells were then placed on ice collected by vigorous pipetting washed and stained with the following fluorophore-conjugated antibodies: anti-CD11c and anti-CD40 (eBioscience) anti-CD80 (BD Horizon) anti-CD86 and anti-MHC class II (I-Aq) (BD Pharmingen). Afterwards the cells were analyzed on an LSRII 4 laser (BD Biosciences). In vitro tumor antigen presentation assay BR5FVB1 cells were harvested and treated with mitomycin C and plated in a 96-well round-bottomed plate with 20 ?g ml scFvMTBHsp70 or 13 ?g ml MTBHsp70. After pre-incubation at 4 C for 1 h CD11c BMDCs (ratio of tumor cells: DCs 3: 1) were added to the wells and the plate was incubated at 37 C for 24 h. For generation of BR5FVB1 cell-primed T cells we inoculated FVB NJ mice by i.p. injection with 107mitomycin C-treated BR5FVB1 cells and sacrificed the mice 60 days after the immunization according to the approved animal protocol. Splenocytes were then harvested and T cells were isolated using the Pan T-Cell Isolation Kit II (MiltenyiBiotec). BR5FVB1 cell-primed T cells were then added to the wells at a DC T-cell ratio of 1:20. After a 24-hour co-culture of BR5FVB1 cell-pulsed DCs with BR5FVB1 cell-primed T cells the cells were harvested washed and resuspended in PBS with 5 FBS stained for CD3 CD4 CD8 and IFN? and analyzed on a LSRII 4 laser (BD Biosciences). In vivo immunization with mitomycin C-treated ovarian tumor cells BR5FVB1 ovarian tumor cells were harvested with enzyme-free cell-dissociation buffer and treated with mitomycin C as described above. Cells were then pre-incubated with scFvMTBHsp70 (10 ?g 106 cells) MTBHsp70 (6.5 ?g 106 cells) or PBS alone at 4 C for 1 h. 6-week-old FVB mice were shaved and depilated on both left and right flanks and then injected i.d. with 50 ?l of PBS or 1? ?106 tumor cells in 50 ?l of PBS with or without a pre-incubation with scFvMTBHsp70 or MTBHsp70 at both flanks. Histopathology Abdominal walls and intestines from mice were fixed for at least 24 h in PBS-buffered 10 formalin. Tissues were routinely embedded in paraffin. 5 ?m thick sections were stained routinely with H E. For staining tumor-infiltrating T cells mice were perfused with 4 paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS and tumor nodules were fixed in 4 PFA PBS for additional 2 hours washed and infiltrated with 30 sucrose PBS at 4 C. 6 ?m thick frozen sections were stained with rat anti-mouse CD8 (BD Biosciences 1:100 dilution) or rat anti-mouse Foxp3 (eBioscience 1:12 dilution) followed by polyclonal rabbit anti-rat immunoglobulin HRP (Dako 1:750 dilution). Signal was developed with diaminobenzidine (DAB Dako). Images were acquired on a Zeiss Axio A1 microscope. All histopathological and immunohistochemical samples were reviewed and the quantitation of the cellular infiltrate was performed in a blinded manner to the observer. Statistical analysis Statistical differences between three or more experimental groups were analyzed using One-Way ANOVA followed by Turkey s multiple comparison tests when mean of each group is compared with that of every other group or followed by Dunnett s multiple comparison tests when mean of each group is compared with that of a control group. Statistical differences between two experimental groups were analyzed using Student s t-test. Survival was analyzed with the Log-rank test. Prism 6.0 software (GraphPad Software) was used for all the statistical analysis.

enriched for carbohydrate metabolism pathways this implies a higher level of fibrefermentation occurring in responders reflecting the selection of bacteria more able to ferment carbohydratesthis could result in more scfa production in the faeces both butyrate and propionate have been proposedto increase histone deacetylase inhibition which is aknown mechanism of cellular radiosensitisation in this study we demonstrated that these phenotypesexist in bladder cancer cells fig 5h i furthermorein vitro studies showed that scfa reduced cell proliferation in liver cancer induced apoptosis in lung cancer and did both in breast cancer vecchia found that acetate and propionate potentiated theanticancer effects of butyrate in leukaemic cervicaladenocarcinoma melanoma and breast cancer cells we

acetate succinate and possiblypropionate but not butyrate high acetate levelscould act as a substrate for butyrate production giventhat acetate is necessary for butyrate productionparticularly in the butyrylcoaacetate coatransferasepathway we speculate that the faecal butyratelevels could have been enhanced due to crossfeeding ofbutyrateproducing bacteria by b acidifaciens proofofconcept was

bacteriaincludingbacteroides and s247 were also seen with increasedparabacteroides which could be of significance herewe only gave a 6gy single fraction of ir which is moreclinically relevant and our findings were not immunologically mediated via t cells as cd1 nude mice lack tcellsto our knowledge ours is the first study to provideevidence that a high soluble fibre diet and its subsequent modification of the gut microbiome can act toradiosensitise tumoursfurthermore b acidifaciens was identified as a potential radiosensitiser because its abundance was enhancedby a high soluble fibre diet and positively correlated withtumour response to radiation and survival time in the ircohort this bacterium was first isolated in andwas so named because it reduces the ph level ofpeptoneyeast broth with fildes digest consistentwith our findings marques demonstrated that ahighfibre diet markedly increased the prevalence of bacidifaciens another study showed b acidifaciensto be enriched in

growth is still controversial a study foundincreased b acidifaciens abundance associated with hepatocellular carcinoma induced by a streptozotocinhighfat diet in contrast b acidifaciens reduces the isoflavone genisten which is associated with increased riskof breast cancer and b acidifaciens was shown tocontribute to the antitumour effect of medicinal gynostemma saponins in this study we revealed that bacterial supernatant from b acidifaciens and its cross 0cthen bmc biology page of feeding with f prausnitzii caused significantly higherlevels of cytotoxicity compared to the other supernatantsfig 5k and additional file figure s5b this resultsupports our finding that b acidifaciens may drive theradiosensitising effect moreover b acidifaciens in vitrohas a greater effect on cell kill than f prausnitzii butyrateproducer p implying that metabolites otherthan butyrate may be involved in its effect studies suggest that a broad range of gut microbiotaderived metabolites can enhance antitumoural effects or tumourresponse to anticancer treatments so futurework should include undertaking a global metabolomicanalysis of b acidifaciensproduced metabolites to identify radiosensitisers otherthan scfas with similarprofileswe also found bacteroidales s247 or candidatushomeothermaceae or muribaculaceae an uncultured bacterium with limited characterisation to behighly

tribe of tanzania who consume tubers containinglarge amounts of soluble fibre this indicates thathigh abundance of bacteroidales s247 found in thisstudy when the tumours reached mm3 might be induced by soluble high fibreenvironmental contamination is an inevitable issue inmicrobiome studies to minimise the influence ofcontamination in this study bacterial loads of sampleswere quantified and appropriate negative controls wereincluded bacterialloads from luminal contents andtissue samples contained more than cfus whichoverrode the environmental bacteria communities furthermore the bacterial compositions of the pbs negativecontrols were very different from those of the studygroups so the environmental microbiome was considered not to be a major source of bias in this studyalthough a strong correlation between b acidifaciensabundance and tumour response to irradiation was seena limitation of this study is that only one cohort of micewas studied further studies are needed to determine thecausal relationship between b acidifaciens and radiosensitisation and its underlying aetiology this could beachieved by oral gavage of b acidifaciens with or without other bacteria in gnotobiotic mice and in vitro culture studies of b acidifaciens as both gut bacteria and irradiation directly interact with the immunesystem further in vivo studies need to be conducted inan immunecompetent model to reveal how immunomodulation might contribute to the radiosensitisationa high soluble fibre diet increased responses of rt112subcutaneous xenografts in cd1 nude mice to

Background The ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene plays an important role in the DNA double-strand breaks repair pathway. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of DNA repair genes are suspected to influence the risk of lung cancer. This study aimed to investigate the association between the ATM -111G A (rs189037) polymorphism environmental risk factors and the risk of lung adenocarcinoma in Chinese female non-smokers. Methods A hospital-based case-control study of 487 lung cancer patients and 516 matched cancer-free controls was conducted. Information concerning demographic and environmental risk factors was obtained for each case and control by a trained interviewer. After informed consent was obtained 10 ml venous blood was collected from each subject for biomarker testing. Single nucleotide polymorphism was determined by using TaqMan method. Results This study showed that the individuals with ATM rs189037 AA genotype were at an increased risk for lung adenocarcinoma compared with those carrying the GA or GG genotype (adjusted odds ratios (OR) 1.44 95 confidence interval (CI) 1.02 2.02 P? ?0.039). The stratified analysis suggested that increased risk associated with ATM rs189037 AA genotype in individuals who never or seldom were exposed to cooking oil fumes (adjusted OR 1.89 95 CI 1.03 3.49 P? ?0.040). Conclusions ATM rs189037 might be associated with the risk of lung adenocarcinoma in Chinese non-smoking females. Furthermore ATM rs189037 AA genotype might be a risk factor of lung adenocarcinoma among female non-smokers without cooking oil fume exposure.

Introduction Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths both worldwide and in China. Although cigarette smoke is the major risk factor for lung cancer only a fraction of smokers develop this disease 1 suggesting that host genetic susceptibility may play an important role in the development of lung cancer. Recent genetic susceptibility studies of lung cancer have focused on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in candidate genes among which DNA repair genes are increasingly studied because of their critical role in maintain genome integrity. Genetic variations in DNA repair genes are thought to affect DNA repair capacity and deficits in DNA repair capacity may lead to genetic instability and carcinogenesis 2 3 .\nLabels: [Thyroid_Cancer, Colon_Cancer, Lung_Cancer]\nReply with one label only.", "assistant": "Lung_Cancer"}

Thirteen days after injection lungs were harvested and stained with Bouin's solution to visualise metastatic colonies. For survival analysis mice were monitored daily for signs of morbidity including body weight hydration level coat appearance mobility and behaviour. Mice that showed cumulative signs meeting the criteria of a moribund state were euthanised. All procedures using laboratory animals were done in accordance with all applicable institutional and government regulatory guidelines and policies were performed in an animal facility accredited by the Center for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care of the Japan Health Sciences Foundation. Statistical analysis Eribulin-treated vs control groups were analysed by the Dunnett multiple comparisons test using two-sided approaches. Values of P 0.05 were considered as statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 5.04 (GraphPad Software La Jolla CA USA) or R (v2.15.2 http: www.r-project. index.html) and SAS (v9.2 2M2 Cary NC USA) programs. Analyses of lung metastatic nodules and survival data were done using Kaplan Meier and log-rank test methods and the Mann Whitney U-test (GraphPad Prism version 6 La Jolla CA USA). Results Eribulin reverses EMT and induces MET in TNBC cells in vitro To investigate the effects of eribulin on EMT MET balance three TNBC cell lines were treated with eribulin for 7 days (A). The doses of eribulin for MX-1 and Hs578T were IC50 and three times IC50 decided by 3 days proliferation assay result (Supplementary Figure S1A). For MDA-MB-157 half IC50 and IC50 of eribulin were selected because almost all cells died after 7 days treatment with three times IC50. Although eribulin strongly inhibited proliferation of these cells surviving cells were no longer spindle shaped like control cultures but instead had flat more epithelial-like morphologies (B). This conversion from mesenchymal to epithelial-like morphologies prompted us to examine alterations in EMT MET-related genes. RNA from surviving TNBC cells treated with eribulin for 7 days was assayed by qPCR analysis. As shown in C (MX-1) D (MDA-MB-157) and E (Hs578T) eribulin treatment consistently upregulated mRNA expression levels of epithelial markers CDH1 and KRT18 while it downregulated mesenchymal markers CDH2 VIM TWIST1 SNAI2 ZEB1 and ZEB2 even though the pattern and degree of these alterations was somewhat different among the three TNBC cell lines (C D and E). Of the three eribulin effects on EMT MET markers were most robust in MX-1 cells so this line was selected for further more detailed analyses. Thus using MX-1 cells western blotting analysis confirmed that protein levels of key EMT MET markers behaved similarly to mRNA expression patterns: eribulin increased levels of E-cadherin protein while decreasing levels of N-cadherin and vimentin proteins (F and G). Taken together results of morphological observations and gene and protein expression patterns strongly point to eribulin-induced reversion of EMT and induction of MET in TNBC cells. Eribulin reverses EMT and induces MET in MX-1 TNBC tumour xenografts in mice Next eribulin's ability to induce a shift from EMT to MET phenotypes was tested in MX-1 tumour xenografts in vivo. MX-1 cells were transplanted into athymic mice to establish MX-1 xenografts followed by treatment of animals with eribulin using the schedule shown in A. Under these conditions eribulin showed a significant antitumour activity as determined by measurement of tumour weights on days 4 and 8 of the study (Supplementary ). Nevertheless even in tumours in the 3?mg?kg?1 eribulin group residual tumour tissues remained intact and showed evidence of tumour vasculature remodelling (Matsui et al 2013; Funahashi et al manuscript in preparation). Therefore an IHC analysis of EMT MET-related proteins in the resected tumours was performed. B showed representative images of IHC staining for E-cadherin N-cadherin and ZEB1 protein in tumours from animals receiving each of the three eribulin treatment dose levels. As shown in all eribulin-treated groups the epithelial E-cadherin signal was increased whereas the mesenchymal N-cadherin and ZEB1 signals were decreased. Quantification of these IHC results for all animals in each group revealed that these alterations were significant at all doses tested when compared with the corresponding vehicle controls (C). Together with results from cell-based studies analysis of protein expression levels in in vivo MX-1 tumour xenografts provides strong evidence for eribulin-induced reversion of EMT and induction of MET in breast cancer cells. Eribulin regulates TGF-? signalling pathway via downregulation of Smad phosphorylation To examine the mechanism by which eribulin induces MET in cells the effect of eribulin on TGF-? Smad signalling a key signalling pathway for induction of EMT was investigated. It is known that TGF-? enhances phosphorylation of receptor-regulated Smad2 and Smad3 proteins resulting in enhanced complexing with Smad4. Translocation of the resulting complex into the nucleus activates transcription of essential EMT-related genes including TWIST1 SNAI1 SNAI2 ZEB1 and others (Takano et al 2007; Gregory et al 2011). To evaluate the effect of eribulin on this pathway MCF10A normal mammary epithelial cells were utilised. These cells represent a non-cancerous triple negative basal cell type and as such are often used as an EMT model since they quickly undergo EMT in response to TGF-?. A shows the treatment scheme of the experiment. The EMT phenotype of MCF10A cells treated with TGF-? for 7 days was confirmed by cell morphology (B) as well as gene expression profiles of epithelial and mesenchymal markers (C). Next effects of eribulin on MCF10A cells already induced to the EMT phenotype by TGF-? treatment were examined. For this analysis eribulin treatment was begun after cells had been induced to the EMT phenotype by 7 days of TGF-? pretreatment and 7 days later cellular morphology and gene expression profiles were examined. The concentration of eribulin used in this experiment was ?0.5 IC50 0.25?nM (see Supplementary Figure S1B). As shown in D on day 15 eribulin treatment reversed the observed phenotype from the previously induced spindle-like EMT morphology seen at day 8 to the original cuboidal morphology typical of TGF-?-untreated cells (compare D right with B left). Furthermore eribulin treatment also significantly upregulated mRNA expression levels of epithelial marker CDH1 while downregulating several mesenchymal markers (E). Finally phosphorylation levels of Smad2 and Smad3 were investigated. MCF10A cells were pretreated with eribulin for 1 day and the phosphorylation status of Smad2 and Smad3 was analysed 1?h after subsequent TGF-? stimulation. As shown in F eribulin pretreatment significantly decreased TGF-?-induced phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 suggesting that the MET induced by eribulin was at least in part due to of downregulation of the TGF-? Smad pathway. Eribulin decreases migration and invasion capacity of MX-1 TNBC cell in vitro One of the functional changes associated with EMT is an increase in migration and invasion capacities traits typically associated with mesenchymal phenotypes. To investigate whether decreases in cell migration and invasion capacities accompany the eribulin-induced shift from EMT to MET phenotypes seen above in vitro migration and invasion assays were conducted. For these studies MX-1 cells were treated for 7 days with 1 or 3?nM eribulin or 10??M 5-FU (active metabolite of capecitabine the comparator used in a recent phase III clinical trial of eribulin; see Kaufman et al 2012) followed by drug washout and evaluation of in vitro migration and invasion in the absence of drugs (A). The concentration of 5-FU used 10??M was approximately a 2 IC50 growth inhibitory concentration (Supplementary Figure S1C). Treatment with eribulin significantly decreased both the migration (B and C) and invasiveness (D and E) capacities of MX-1 cells in vitro. In contrast although treatment with 5-FU also decreased both migration and invasiveness of MX-1 cells such effects were smaller than those seen with eribulin (B E). Eribulin treatment decreases lung metastases and prolongs survival in MX-1 in vivo experimental metastasis model Finally we utilised an in vivo experimental metastasis model to investigate whether MX-1 cells pretreated with eribulin have a reduced capacity to generate metastatic lung nodules and whether the host mice would survive longer. Equivalent numbers of MX-1 cells pretreated in vitro with DMSO 1?nM eribulin or 3??M 5-FU for 7 days were injected into tail veins of mice followed 13 days later by assessment of the number of metastatic lung nodules. To exclude the possibility that pretreated cells had lost their viability at the time of injection proliferation rates of samples of pretreated cells (i.e. cells identical to those injected into mice) were measured after washout of the drugs. Results indicated that the post-washout proliferation rates of both eribulin- and 5-FU-pretreated cells were slightly slower at 2 days but had recovered to virtually identical rates as DMSO control cells by day 4 indicating that all post-washout cells injected into tail veins retained full viability and proliferative capacity (Supplementary Figure S2). Thirteen days after tail vein injection numbers of metastatic lung nodules were assessed. As shown in Figure 5A and B animals injected with MX-1 cells pretreated with eribulin showed dramatic reductions in the number of metastatic lung nodules compared with controls. Pretreatment of MX-1 cells with 5-FU also led to a reduction in numbers of metastatic lung nodules compared with controls (Figure 5A and B) albeit to a considerably lesser degree than seen with eribulin. Next we examined whether the observed reductions in lung metastases were associated with prolonged survival. As shown in Figure 5C control mice started to die around 13 days after DMSO-treated MX-1 cell injection with mice in the 5-FU group starting to die only a few days later. By day 21 all mice in both the DMSO and 5-FU groups had died. In marked contrast the first deaths in the eribulin-treated group were not seen until day 39 with the final survival rate at the conclusion of the study on day 80 being 60 (Figure 5C) linking the reduction in metastases to functional prolongation of survival. Discussion Recent advances in novel drug development strategies have improved treatment paradigms for hormone-sensitive and HER2 overexpressing breast cancers; however the most malignant and heterogeneous subtype TNBC remains largely intractable due to an aggressive metastatic character and rapid recurrence after treatment. Emerging results from many groups suggest that TNBC's resistance to chemotherapy may be explained in part by the EMT hypothesis. Epithelial mesenchymal transition progression is characterised by a transition from epithelial to mesenchymal phenotype loss of proteins involved in cell junctions such as E-cadherin and increased expression of mesenchymal markers such as N-cadherin and vimentin. Moreover circulating tumour cells (CTCs) involved in breast cancer metastasis are reported to harbour mesenchymal characteristics (Yu et al 2013) and gene signatures of mesenchymal type cells induced by EMT are highly correlated with those of cancer stem cells (Shipitsin et al 2007; Mani et al 2008; Taube et al 2010). Thus the processes of tumour aggressiveness chemoresistance metastasis and invasion appear to be inextricably linked to EMT. The current preclinical studies represent an attempt to identify the scientific basis behind clinical observations of eribulin's enhancement of OS without corresponding increases in PFS. The studies described here have uncovered a potential new biology associated with eribulin treatment regulation of tumour EMT MET balance which may add a new dimension to eribulin's known antimitotic antiproliferative effects on cancer cells. Results in support of this conclusion are several-fold. First in TNBC cells in vitro eribulin promoted a shift from EMT to MET states as shown by phenotypic shifts from mesenchymal to epithelial morphologies as well as changes in EMT MET-related markers strongly favouring MET. Second eribulin treatment of mice bearing TNBC xenografts led to increased tumour expression of epithelial markers concurrent with decreased levels of mesenchymal markers. Third eribulin treatment of TNBC cells in vitro led to decreased cellular migration and invasiveness capacities an observation consistent with the known functional phenotype of MET. Finally eribulin pretreated TNBC cells had a significantly decreased capacity to colonise the lung in an in vivo experimental metastasis model findings that also correlated with significant prolongation of survival. It has been shown in several reports that the primary target of eribulin is tubulin and microtubules (Towle et al 2001; Kuznetsov et al 2004; Jordan et al 2005; Okouneva et al 2008; Smith et al 2010). However the relationship between microtubule regulation and EMT has received little attention. Smad proteins which are essential mediators of TGF-? signalling pathway normally bind microtubules in the absence of TGF-? but dissociate from them upon TGF-? stimulation (Dong et al 2000). Dissociated Smad2 and Smad3 become phosphorylated and then associate with Smad4 followed by translocation of the entire complex to the nucleus where it activates transcription. Eribulin inhibits the growth phase of microtubule dynamics (Jordan et al 2005) by binding to high affinity sites on microtubule plus ends (Smith et al 2010) possibly resulting in maintenance of the association between Smad proteins and microtubules with consequent inhibition of Smad phosphorylation. In fact the microtubule stabiliser paclitaxel even with a distinct mode of action from eribulin decreased Smad2 phosphorylation in gastric cancer (Tsukada et al 2013). On the other hand the microtubule destabiliser nocodazole enhances the release of Smad proteins from microtubules and thus increases their phosphorylation (Dong et al 2000). Although it cannot be excluded that eribulin may have other unique targets to evoke MET the precedents set by paclitaxel and nocodazole in altering Smad-related signalling suggests that eribulin binding to microtubules may at least partially explain its induction of MET in TNBC cells as observed in our studies. Involvement of EMT in drug resistance has been reported in several cancer types. For instance positive staining for the mesenchymal marker Vimentin appears in specimens from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who develop resistance to EGFR inhibitors suggesting that EMT has been triggered in such tumours (Uramoto et al 2010; Chung et al 2011; Sequist et al 2011). It will be interesting to determine whether eribulin reverses the EMT phenotype of lung cancer cells preclinically to reduce resistance to EGFR inhibitors. An important caveat to the studies presented here is that it is not currently known whether other tubulin-targeting agents such as the taxanes vinca alkaloids or epothilones have effects on EMT MET balance similar to those described here for eribulin. Studies are currently ongoing to investigate this important question. In conclusion the preclinical studies presented here reveal that in addition to having a primary anticancer mechanism associated with classical antimitotic effects eribulin may also render residual tumours less aggressive and less likely to metastasise by triggering a shift from mesenchymal to epithelial phenotypes via reversal of the EMT state to the MET state.

a day days a week for all adults our study demonstrated that a high proportion of radiologists did not engage in regular physicalactivity and did not exercise even once a week this isaggravated by the fact that the practice of clinical radiology has become more sedentary in the pacs era potentially leading to negative effects on the general healthof radiologists in our study there was a significant difference in thefrequency of physical exercise between men and womenwith men being more likely to engage in most types ofphysical exercises this might be due to traditional cultural practices and the differences in gender roles whichmay contribute to the unavailability of exercise facilitiesand lead to time constraints due to child care requirements previous studies have reported similarfindings with one study of adults in malaysia demonstrating differences in the motives of exercise betweenmen and women according to this study intrinsic factors eg gaining strength were more likely to motivatemen to engage in physical exercise whereas extrinsicfactorseg weight management and attaining anattractive appearance were larger motivators amongwomen counterintuitively our study found a positive association between age and the frequency of physical exercises a possible explanation for this finding is thehealthy worker effect phenomenon owing to which individuals who are physically inactive and have medicalcomorbidities are more likely to leave the workforceearlier unsurprisingly walking was the most commonphysical exercise in our study as it can be performed atany time and placeour findings demonstrated that participants performing regular physical exercises had a lower likelihood ofexperiencing disabling musculoskeletal symptoms especially neck and shoulder pain which

{"system": "You are a medical text classifier. Choose exactly one label.", "user": "Text: the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sarscov2 has caused the greatest worldwide pandemic since the flu the consequences of the coronavirus disease covid19 are devastating and represent the current major public health issue across the globe at the onset sarscov2 primarily attacks the respiratory system as it represents the main point of entry in the host but it also can affect multiple ans although most of the patients do not present symptoms or are mildly symptomatic some people infected with sarscov2 that experience more severe multian dysfunction the severity of covid19 is typically combined with a set of comorbidities such as hypertension diabetes obesity andor advanced age that seriously exacerbates the consequences of the infection also sarscov2 can cause gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting diarrhea or abdominal pain during the early phases of the disease intestinal dysfunction induces changes in intestinal microbes and an increase in inflammatory cytokines thus diagnosing gastrointestinal symptoms that precede respiratory problems during covid19 may be necessary for improved early detection and treatment uncovering the composition of the microbiota and its metabolic products in the context of covid19 can help determine novel biomarkers of the disease and help identify new therapeutic targets elucidating changes to the microbiome as reliable biomarkers in the context of covid19 represent an overlooked piece of the disease puzzle and requires further investigation 0c introduction severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sarscov2 also called 2019ncov arose in the province of wuhan china in december sarscov2 causes severe respiratory disease coronavirus disease covid19 on march the world health anization determined that the outbreak of a novel coronavirus had reached spreading pandemic as of august there are over million confirmed cases worldwide with more than associated global deaths according to johns hopkins university over the last months the global population has been facing problems that impact both world health and global socioeconomics covid19 has been and continues to be the focus of concern in a society threatened by the most destructive pandemic since the flu transmission symptoms vaccines and treatments for covid19 continue to be investigated hiding too many unknowns the immediate strategy to curb the spread of this virus has been to recommend that people carry out a social vaccination which involves restricting social gatherings minimizing public appearances telecommuting implementing social distancing or wear masks as much as possible this is based on the high transmission ability of the sarscov2 via large respiratory droplets and by airborne routes unlike other viruses in the coronavirus family sarscov2 infects people who then have little or no symptoms despite all this asymptomatic covid19 positive individuals can spread the virus this silent transmission capacity is the main reason this virus continues to transmit and infect the global population in an accelerated and uncontrollable way in spite of best efforts to control and curb spread asymptomatic people manage to eliminate the virus without developing typical covid19 symptoms and this suggests to us that the immune system is relevant and may have the key to beat this virus covid19 affects not only the respiratory and cardiovascular systems but also to the central nervous system cns and gastrointestinal system the objective of this review is to examine whether the sarscov2 infection linked to gastrointestinal changes may be linked to 0c specific phases of covid19 associated to inflammation we will explore the studies on microbiome profiling intestinal immune system in the patients with covid19 this review will provide insights for microbiota modification therapy in the early stages of covid19 beyond antiviral and antiinflammatory approaches new therapeutic interventions might be possible through the restoration of the gut microbiome of individuals infected by sarscov2 to mitigate systemic inflammation intestinal damage and limit the effects caused in the cns through the braingut axis early and late stage of the infection of sarscov2 a multitude of epidemiological studies describe different phases in the development of covid19 the early or viral phase shortly after infection marked by a high viral load and a reduced inflammatory activity with hardly any symptoms and which is also associated with gastrointestinal illness figure besides patients with covid19 who had the highest viral load levels at the beginning of the infection and subsequently decreased over time could explain the rapid spread of the disease during the progressive or late phase of infection covid19 positive individuals develop most severe symptoms like respiratory problems and fever immune cells like neutrophils infiltrating monocytes and macrophages produce inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species also respiratory manifestations such as cough sputum production and shortness of breath remain the most common symptoms following fever or pneumonia in a study with covid19 patients serum level of cytokines as interleukin il6 and il10 were indicators of disease severity showing that high levels of proinflammatory cytokine storm were associated with more severe disease development some patients with covid19 had severe complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome ards cardiovascular conditions multiple an dysfunction syndromes or septic shock these complications are related to the release of cytokines and hyperinflammation or cytokine storm syndrome figure a person is more infectious in 0c the initial phase when the symptomatology of the disease does not manifest itself with respiratory symptoms and however the presymptomatic transmission may play an important role nevertheless detecting sarscov2 infection in those without fever andor respiratory symptoms is difficult because sarscov2 tests are not usually performed in infected people without these symptoms in summary a subset of the symptoms associated with covid19 during the initial phase are intestinal complications such as vomiting or diarrhea detecting these symptoms might not only lead to slowdown in transmission but also open the door to novel treatments that could reduce the severity of covid19 more studies are necessary to interpret the phases of the disease correctly and especially if the viral load detected is considered infectious and how it is related to respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms clinical characteristics of covid19 patients with digestive symptoms and intestinal inflammation covid19 is an emerging infection that causes great concern about respiratory manifestations furthermore diarrhea and other gastrointestinal symptoms are frequently observed in patients with covid19 however the significance remains undetermined a viral infection causes an alteration of intestinal permeability resulting in enterocyte dysfunction when we investigate what happened with another coronavirus we found that diarrhea was a frequent symptom in sars patients occurring in intestinal problems were also associated with the severity of the infection patients with diarrhea had an increased need for respiratory assistance and intensive care sarscov was also identified in ileal and terminal colonic biopsies regarding mers several studies showed the presence of diarrhea between to of known cases however a less severe prognosis of the disease was observed in mers patients with diarrhea 0c the first results linking intestinal problems with covid19 were obtained from patients in wuhan china two hundred four patients with covid19 presented at three hospitals indicate that the majority of covid19 patients had typical respiratory symptoms however many patients infected with the coronavirus complained of digestive symptoms such as diarrhea there is no evidence on the efficacy of antidiarrheal drugs but adequate rehydration and potassium monitoring should be performed as in all covid19 patients diarrhea should generate awareness of a possible sarscov2 infection and should be investigated to reach an early diagnosis of covid19 this factor should be considered when suspecting whether the patients are infected instead of waiting for respiratory symptoms to appear which would give us an earlier diagnosis unless the coronavirus tests are also performed on asymptomatic individuals patients with covid19 specifically those with digestive symptoms remained a long time from onset to hospital admission and a worse clinical outcome compared to patients who do not suffer from these symptoms likewise patients with digestive symptoms had an average time of days from the onset of symptoms until admission while patients with respiratory symptoms had an admission time of days this may indicate that those with digestive symptoms waited longer to be diagnosed in the hospital as they did not suspect they were sarscov2 positive in the absence of respiratory symptoms authors also state that patients with digestive symptoms presented other associated clinical manifestations such as anorexia diarrhea vomiting or abdominal pain as the severity of the disease increased gi symptoms became more pronounced but especially the high percentage of patients admitted with symptoms of anorexia one study indicated that covid19 patients experience gastrointestinal gi symptoms such as diarrhea anorexia and nausea however the underlying pathophysiology gastrointestinal is not well understood another study analyzed hospitalized patients and some of them showed mild initial gi symptoms such as diarrhea nausea vomiting and abdominal pain which preceded the characteristic fever and respiratory problems such as dry cough in another study diarrhea 0c was reported in patients and the fecal test remained positive until days after the disease onset in patients the stool test was still positive despite negative respiratory tests another study with patients with low severity of covid19 including presenting with digestive symptoms alone shows that patients with gastrointestinal symptoms had a longer duration between symptom onset and viral clearance and fecal viruspositive than those with respiratory symptoms a systematic metaanalysis of shows results from clinical studies with an incidence rate of diarrhea from as low as and up to of the cases how is this disparity in the data possible more clinical studies are required to elucidate the percentage of covid19 patients that develop intestinal symptoms and if these depend on other factors such as age gender or other comorbidities gastrointestinal symptoms are accompanied by inflammation or intestinal damage there is a loss of intestinal barrier integrity and gut microbes that can activate innate and adaptive immune cells to release proinflammatory cytokines into the circulatory system leading to systemic inflammation some intestinal signaling pathways can regulate inflammation through dendritic cells figure immunomodulation of the innate host immunity through the activation of epithelial receptors could represent a novel therapeutic target to eliminate sarscov2 in the early stage of the infection the viral load of coronavirus appeared in the feces of of the infected patients an interaction between viral shedding of sarscov2 in stool has been reported but its association with infection was yet to be determined identifying fecal coronavirus rna may also lead researchers to ask new questions is there transmission of the coronavirus found in fecal samples what these researchers found is the presence of the coronavirus in the stool but there is controversial studies about if viral load was infectious nor examples of transmission previously a study involving patients with covid19 reported that the median duration of viral shedding was days in survivors range â days cultivable sarscov2 was detected in stool or urine specimens for longer than weeks in three convalescent patients days suggesting that it may remain viable 0c contradictorily high sarscov2 titres detectable in the first week of illness with an early peak observed at symptom onset to day of disease although sarscov2 rna shedding in respiratory and stool can be prolonged the duration of a viable virus is relatively shortlived the presence of sarscov2 including live virus with infectious capacity in the feces of asymptomatic individuals implies that covid19 could be transmitted through the fecal route sarscov2 shedding in stool samples is detectable over a longer period than in nasopharyngeal swabs donors for fecal microbiota transplant for sarscov2 must be strict and validated to prevent the potential risk of transmission the results show that the elevated levels of fecal calprotectin in patients with covid19 add to the growing evidence that sarscov2 infection causes an inflammatory response in the intestine calprotectin concentrations were significantly higher in covid19 patients who had suffered from diarrhea and with more elevated serum il6 levels in the diagnosis and especially in the followup of covid19related diarrhea the calprotectin measurement could play a potential role in monitoring the disease also diarrhea may be secondary to virusinduced inflammation which in turn is due to the entry of inflammatory cells into the intestinal mucosa including neutrophils and lymphocytes and thus disruption of the gut microbiota viral sarscov2 ps were detected in feces during the second phase of covid19 accompanied by a decrease in the peak of inflammation therefore covid19related inflammatory diarrhea was associated with reduced levels of fecal sarscov2 rna however intestinal damage can manifest after respiratory symptoms as reported in a clinical case there may be a pathogenic role of sarscov2 on the gi in zheijiang china it was detected that half of the covid19 patients tested positive for rtpcr in their feces and intestinal microbial dysbiosis was also identified viral strains alive from feces were isolated indicating potential infectiousness of feces another analysis conducted from studies in china usa and singapore had also detected 0c sarscov2 rna in fecal specimens of patients at an average of this percentage is according to their clinical forecast intestinal problems or with more severe disease furthermore the fecal test for sarscov2 rna also bears a potential implication for physicians to decide the subsequent isolation strategies for those with positive fecal samples the possibility of the fecaloral route of transmission of sarscov2 should be investigated all candidates for fecal microbiota transplantation and healthy donors should be screened for the virus one could consider studies on the gut microbiome and its therapeutic role in transplanting feces in healthy donors to critically ill covid19 patients still precautions should be taken because infectious sarscov2 ps are known to have been found in covid19 positive feces the use of fecal transplants could be one of the immediate solutions in critically ill patients with a weakened immune system sarscov2 interaction with intestinal ace2 receptors sarscov2 enters cells primarily through binding of protein s to angiotensinconverting enzyme ii ace2 receptors to infected cells the central role of ace2 in the cleavage of angiotensin i to angiotensin ii a peptide involved in vascular homeostasis vasomotor tone and blood pressure regulation ace2 receptors are expressed in various human cells susceptible to viral infection including epithelial cells in the lungs small intestine and colon tubular cells of the kidney neuronal and glial cells in the brain enterocytes vascular endothelial cells smooth muscle cells and cardiomyocytes a very recent study has reported on the expression pattern of ace2 across more than different cell types corresponding to all major human tissues and ans based on rigorous immunohistochemical analysis sarscov2 also uses the receptors for transmembrane protease serine tmrpss2 an enzyme that is expressed in the small intestinal epithelial cells to entry to the infected cells figure the sarscov2 activity could cause ace2 modifications in the gut that increase susceptibility to 0c intestinal inflammation and diarrhea a high coexpression of ace2 and tmprss2 was detected in enterocytes and the esophagus and lungs the coexpression of ace2 and tmprss2 transcripts was highest in the small intestine with expressed in enterocytes and in colon cells as demonstrated by a singlecell rna sequencing study in gi ace2 is not only playing an essential role in intestinal inflammation but also have a significant impact on the composition of the intestinal microbiota ace2 ko mice have been shown to have decreased expression of antimicrobial peptides and exhibited altered intestinal microbial composition which is restored by the administration of tryptophan likewise it is known that there is a connection of transport of ace2 amino acid with microbial ecology in the gut during sarscov2 infection in another recent study using gnotobiotic germfree rats was observed a decrease in ace2 expression in the colon that contributed to the pathology during covid19 there are numerous studies that have shown that by regulating the reninangiotensin system ras which includes ace2 one can modulate systemic inflammation angiotensin ii receptor blockers are widely used compounds that are therapeutically effective in cardiovascular disorders renal disease metabolic syndrome and diabetes under normal healthy conditions homeostasis of rasace2 occurs while a perturbation to this system is observed in cardiovascular disease hypertension and diabetes mellitus a reduction of ace2 is associated with hypertension diabetes and cardiovascular problems which represent the significant comorbidities of covid19 sarscov2 may potentially further upregulate ras in cardiovascular patients and deplete ace2 downregulation of ace2 levels in tissues has been linked to viral replication efficiency and pathogenicity leading to the imbalance of positive and negative regulation of ras rasace2 imbalance in covid19 may greatly exacerbate tissue inflammation and may contribute to more adverse covid19 outcomes in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease and other comorbidities ace2 receptors may represent a target for covid19 treatments in patients with cardiovascular risk burden susceptible to conditions that worsen asymmetries in rasace2 however suppression of 0c ace2protective roles due to ace2 depletion upon sarscov2 infection is very likely to uphold the poor outcomes observed in covid19 patients especially in those with preexisting conditions ace2 also displays nonrasrelated roles linked with neutral amino acids transport and gut homeostasis ace2 has been implicated in the intestinal epithelium regulation of gut microbiota composition and function in summary ace2 imbalance is likely a key player for the poor outcomes in the covid19 patients with preexisting comorbidities and addresses a possible link for gut microbiota dysbiosis in this interplay the effects of covid19 on the gut microbiome primary inflammatory stimuli trigger the release of microbial products and cytokines which can cause microbial dysbiosis that can induce an inflammatory environment releasing intestinal cytokines into the circulatory system increasing the systemic inflammation of covid19 taken together a combined inflammation can potentially initiate an immune reaction that can create even more harm than the virus itself it is necessary to know the host cytokine pathways and microbiota interactions with cytokine responses in sarscov2 infection to develop novel treatment approaches it is essential to investigate how intestinal bacteria interact in response to sarscov2 infection among covid19 patients an increase of a blood proteomic risk score prs was associated with a risk of becoming a clinically severe infection a recent study has shown more than proteins in bloodrelated to the severity of covid19 these proteins included immune factors that are elevated during systemic inflammation such as creactive protein crp correlations between prs and the intestinal microbiome might be associated with the severity of covid19 this new analysis would allow us to predict if the patient would develop more severe symptoms in the next days or weeks after the infection ruminococcus gnavus was identified in covid19 patients and positively correlated with inflammatory markers while 0c clostridia was negatively correlated another small study of patients hospitalized in hong kong has served to establish a gut microbiome profile in association with covid19 severity and changes in fecal shedding of sarscov2 through the application of indepth shotgun metagenomics analysis the authors investigated longitudinal changes of the gut microbiome in covid19 the abundance of coprobacillus clostridium ramosum and clostridium hathewayi correlated with covid19 severity and it was observed an inverse correlation between the abundance of faecalibacterium prausnitzii an antiinflammatory bacterium during the hospitalization time were detected in covid19 patients bacteroides dorei bacteroides thetaiotaomicron bacteroides massiliensis and bacteroides ovatus which downregulate the expression of ace2 in the murine gut correlating inversely with sarscov2 load in fecal samples this study opens the doors to possible interventions for gut microbiota in hospitalized patients to reduce the severity of covid19 another study of just patients showed that the gut bacteria was associated with fecal sarscov2 load the gut microbiome remained substantially different in hospitalized patients from that of healthy controls a total of bacterial species were identified to be significantly associated with the fecal viral load of sarscov2 across all fecal samples this does not indicate that the gut microbiome is affected for long periods after recovery and future therapeutic interventions would be necessary sarscov2 was detected in feces of hospitalized patients with covid19 and the viral transcriptional activity was analyzed to determine the infectivity range associated with the gut microbiome fecal samples with a signature of high sarscov2 infectivity had higher abundances of bacterial species collinsella aerofaciens collinsella tanakaei streptococcus infantis and manella manii in contrast fecal samples with a signature of lowto no sarscov2 infectivity had higher abundances of scfas producing bacteria parabacteroides merdae bacteroides stercoris alistipes onderdonkii and lachnospiraceae bacterium however live sarscov2 was not isolated from the feces covid19 patients another study 0c of covid19 patients showed a significantly reduced bacterial diversity and a higher relative abundance they compared these results with h1n1 patients who showed lower bacteria diversity compared with covid19 patients specific microbial signatures were identified in covid19 patients which could help identify biomarkers that differentiate them from influenza a h1n1 patients when there is a coinfection despite this the phases of the disease were not established in this study furthermore in another study with covid19 patients was observed a reduced alpha diversity in microbes the metatranscriptional analysis revealed that there were differentially genes associated with immune pathways and cytokine signaling related to the diagnosis and severity of covid19 such as interferongamma signaling despite reporting interesting patterns the studies mentioned above are not without limitations the bioinformatics analyses employed in these studies does not guarantee specieslevel nor strainlevel bacterial identification furthermore no longitudinal analysis has been performed with the same patients to determine if these bacteria change after recovery from covid19 more studies that prospectively include infected but asymptomatic subjects positive for sarscov2 but with different degrees of symptoms would be necessary to establish a correlation with microbial markers or their products monitoring early in the disease during early onset of covid19 and over the longterm will help to delineate the role of changes in the microbiome will be critically important to elucidating this connection further another major limitation is the small number of patients and the absence of information about microbial changes in the context of covid19 that define broad groups of the population stratified by geography ethnicity gender andor age to date there are no metabolomics and metaproteomic analysis studies that are needed to explore the products of these bacteria and their function by identifying microbial metabolites associated with covid19 we can understand what components these bacteria produce during covid19 that help us understand the influence of the communication pathways of the microbiotagutperiphery axis relevant to the association between sarscov2 and 0c hyperinflammation moreover more studies investigating the correlation between sarscov2 and gut inflammation are necessary including histopathology and molecular diagnostic assessments comorbidities as risk factors for covid19 associated with loss of microbial diversity sarscov2 can infect people of all ages but older adults and people with preexisting medical conditions appear to be more vulnerable to becoming seriously ill with the virus there are many hypotheses as to why this occurs still one of the factors could be the loss of microbial diversity associated with aging and with it higher susceptibility to inflammation comorbidities play an essential role in determining the risk of severe complications and death after covid19 infection covid19 comorbidities and risk factors include asthma hypertension smoking male gender or alzheimer's disease or dementia changes in gut microbiota have been previously linked to all of these comorbidities and this deregulation could also be associated with changes in the immune system and the susceptibility to suffer more severe consequences of covid19 and genderrelated differences in vulnerability to complications of covid19 our microbiome changes as we age which favors less diversity and a more significant inflammatory state covid19 appears to be more dangerous in older people men and with comorbidities the gut microbiota evolves during human life the infant microbiota shows reduced diversity and will remain unstable for the first few years of experience until it becomes an adultlike microbiota the gut microbiota within an individual is considered stable throughout adult life in the elderly gut microbiota diversity decreases and dysbiosis increases and is associated with cognitive deficits depression and inflammatory markers a change that is found repeatedly in the microbiota of the elderly is the decrease in the ratio of firmicutes to bacteroidetes decreased bacterial diversity as well as lower levels in specific bacterial groups have also been observed in very elderly at the genus and species 0c level the findings vary significantly between studies although bacteroides clostridium and lactobacillus appear recurrently altered in elderly individuals tragically a high rate of covid19 fatalities is associated with groups of people over years old the causes may be the inability to overcome the infection the weakness of the immune system and the reduced microbiome diversity causing the coronavirus to strongly attack this group of the population causing a higher mortality rate another recent study has found significant associations between dietary patterns and measures of gut microbial composition in older men the group of the population with the highest mortality rate from covid19 obesity is also associated with changes in the intestinal flora and is another risk factor in the severity of covid19 therefore another comorbidity in adults and children in the united states at least of patients who die from covid19 have obesity which is similar to the reported rates of cardiovascular disease in the same highrisk group it is necessary to study the relationship between obesity and the severity of the covid19 disease adipose tissue can serve as a reservoir for the spread of sarscov2 virus clearance and systemic immune activation adipocytes in obese patients express higher levels of ace2 and a reduction or elimination of already inflamed adipose tissue can reduce systemic viral spread viral entry and prolongation in obese individuals there is marked dysregulation of myeloid and lymphoid responses within adipose tissue associated with dysregulation of cytokine profiles obese patients also have heightened levels of proinflammatory adipokines leukotrienes chemerin among others which may exacerbate their risk for cytokine storm syndrome and death the alteration of the immune system causes changes in the intestinal flora and it remains to be seen whether the coronavirus also induces changes in the bacteria that modulate many of these functions of the intestinal brainmicrobiota axis the bacterial intestinal flora plays a critical role in the regulation of neurological functions such as depression or anxiety surely the results of these studies allow us to know 0c what the role of intestinal flora is in covid19 and its relationship with neurological problems at long term furthermore diabetes is another disease associated with increased severity of symptoms and complications of covid19 and this can be attributed to systemic inflammation and gutmetabolite dysfunction individuals suffering from cardiovascular disease who become infected with sarscov2 are at increased risk of developing a worse prognosis of covid19 and also develop cardiovascular complications including myocardial infarction arrhythmias stroke or heart feature or myocardial suppression cardiovascular disease is accompanied by an imbalance of gut microbiota and a decreased microbiome diversity hypertension is likely to be influenced by diet lifestyle factors and microbiome notably an increase in shortchain fatty acids scfa was previously associated with decreased blood pressure and improved arterial compliance changes in the gut microbiota composition through diet to deal with covid19 the impact of dietary patterns on susceptibility to and severity of infection with the sarscov2 virus has been largely ignored to date the commensal microbiome forms a dynamic environment that can be altered and cause dysbiosis from virus infection but can be positively modulated by diet components and probiotic treatments several studies show than an optimal immune response depends on proper diet and nutrition to control sarscov2 infection in general malnutrition can compromise the immune response therefore affecting the vulnerability of the response to covid19 consideration of the dietary and nutritional components the factors during viral infection can serve to strengthen the immune system for the prevention of infections and a meaningful and balanced basis for an immune response is an adequate and balanced diet intake of a sufficient amount of protein is crucial for the production of antibodies also a low level of vitamin a or zinc has been associated with an increased risk of infection branchedchain amino acids can maintain the hairy morphology of 0c the intestines and increase intestinal immunoglobulin levels thereby improving the intestinal barrier therefore highquality proteins are an essential component of an antiinflammatory diet nutritional dietary components known to exert antiinflammatory and antioxidant

Choose exactly one label.", "user": "Text: Background: This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of ziv-aflibercept in combination with cisplatin and pemetrexed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods: This single arm multicentre phase II trial enrolled patients with previously untreated locally advanced or metastatic non-squamous NSCLC. Patients received intravenous ziv-aflibercept 6?mg?kg?1 pemetrexed 500?mg?m?2 and cisplatin 75?mg?m?2 every 21 days for up to six cycles. Maintenance administration of ziv-aflibercept was to continue until disease progression intolerable toxicity or other cause for withdrawal. The co-primary end points were objective response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS). Planned sample size was 72 patients. Results: The study was closed prematurely because of three confirmed and two suspected cases of reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS). A total of 42 patients were enrolled. Median age was 61.5 years; 55 were male 86 Caucasian and 50 had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) 0. A median of four cycles of ziv-aflibercept was administered. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) of any grade were nausea (69 ) and fatigue (67 ) with hypertension (36 ) as the most common grade 3 4 TEAE. Of the 38 evaluable patients ORR was 26 and median PFS was 5 months. Conclusion: Cases of RPLS had been observed in other studies in the ziv-aflibercept clinical development programme but the rate observed in this study was higher than previously observed. This might be related to declining renal function and or hypertension. Although ORR and PFS were in accordance with most historical first-line NSCLC studies this combination of ziv-aflibercept cisplatin pemetrexed will not be further explored in NSCLC. ziv-aflibercept non-small cell lung cancer reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome anti-angiogenesis Cancer growth is dependent upon angiogenesis to maintain a source of nutrition and oxygen (Folkman 1995) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has a key role in tumour angiogenesis (Ferrara and Davis-Smyth 1997). Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) produces VEGF and high serum levels of VEGF are correlated with poor prognosis (Korpanty et al 2010). Anti-angiogenic therapy thus aims to disrupt blood supply to tumours and has proven clinical benefit in non-squamous NSCLC (Jain 2001). Combination chemotherapy is used for the first-line treatment of advanced metastatic NSCLC (Schiller et al 2002). The addition of the anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab to carboplatin paclitaxel in this setting improved response rate progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS; Sandler et al 2006). Similarly bevacizumab improved PFS when added to cisplatin gemcitabine although OS was not significantly prolonged as a secondary end point in this case (Reck et al 2009). For non-squamous histology cisplatin pemetrexed is a very active combination chemotherapy (Scagliotti et al 2008) and thus combinations of platinum pemetrexed with bevacizumab or other anti-angiogenics are of strong interest for the first-line treatment of advanced metastatic non-squamous NSCLC (Patel et al 2009b). Ziv-aflibercept (ZALTRAP Sanofi Bridgewater NJ USA and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Tarrytown NY USA) is a recombinant fusion protein consisting of portions of human VEGF receptor extracellular domains fused to the Fc portion of human immunoglobulin (Gaya and Tse 2012). Ziv-aflibercept binds VEGF-A by acting as a high-affinity ligand trap to prevent binding to its endogenous receptor VEGFR-2 thereby inhibiting VEGF-induced angiogenesis in preclinical models (Lassoued et al 2010). Endothelial cells expressing high levels of VEGFR-2 were highly susceptible to blockade by ziv-aflibercept (Sitohy et al 2011). In addition ziv-aflibercept binds PIGF (placental growth factor) and VEGF-B which could potentially inhibit cancer invasion (Dowlati 2010). Studies have investigated ziv-aflibercept as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents in treatment of various types of cancers (Lockhart et al 2010; Tew et al 2010; de Groot et al 2011; Isambert et al 2012). In August 2012 ziv-aflibercept was approved by the US FDA for use in metastatic colorectal cancer based on the results of VELOUR trial (Van Cutsem et al 2012). A phase II study using ziv-aflibercept as monotherapy demonstrated objective responses in heavily pretreated patients with advanced adenocarcinoma of the lung (Leighl et al 2010) and improvement in response and PFS (but not OS) was observed in combination with docetaxel as second-line treatment of NSCLC (Ramlau et al 2012). We report the results of a phase II trial of ziv-aflibercept in combination with cisplatin and pemetrexed in patients with advanced or metastatic non-squamous NSCLC. This study was conducted after a phase I trial using the same regimen of ziv-aflibercept cisplatin pemetrexed (Diaz-Padilla et al 2012). That phase I trial determined the recommended dose of ziv-aflibercept (6?mg?kg?1 every 21 days) to be used in the current phase II trial which aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ziv-aflibercept in combination with cisplatin and pemetrexed in the first-line treatment of advanced metastatic NSCLC. Materials and methods Eligibility Patients eligible for this study had histologically cytologically confirmed untreated locally advanced metastatic NSCLC and they had to have measurable disease as per the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria (Therasse et al 2000). Patients with squamous histology and or cavitating lesions were excluded. Patients were 18 years of age or older and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) of 0 or 1 with adequate bone marrow renal and hepatic functions and calculated creatinine clearance (CrCL) ?60?ml?min?1. Patients were excluded from the study if they had brain or central nervous system metastases; systolic blood pressure (BP) 150?mm?Hg and or diastolic blood pressure 100?mm?Hg; bleeding diathesis or evidence of active bleeding; or recent significant cardiovascular cerebrovascular or thromboembolic conditions. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Boards at each participating institution. Informed consent was obtained from each patient. Study design This is a single arm open label multicentre phase II study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00794417). Patients received the three-drug combination intravenously on day 1 of every 21 days with ziv-aflibercept (6?mg?kg?1) first followed by pemetrexed (500?mg?m?2) and cisplatin (75?mg?m?2). Premedications consisted of folic acid vitamin B12 and dexamethasone as a prophylactic measure to reduce pemetrexed-related toxicities and standard anti-emetics. Patients could receive up to six cycles of combination therapy. For patients who completed the combined chemotherapy maintenance ziv-aflibercept every 21 days was to continue until disease progression intolerable toxicity or withdrawal from the study. End points and assessments The two co-primary end points were objective response rate (ORR) and PFS. The ORR was defined as the proportion of patients with complete response plus partial response (CR PR). The PFS was defined as the time interval from the first dose of combination chemotherapy to tumour progression or death whichever occurred first. Secondary variables were the determination of the adverse events (AEs) pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamic profiles (including anti-ziv-aflibercept antibody and hematopoiesis). Pharmacokinetic end points included the area under the concentration curve maximum concentration (Cmax) clearance and terminal half-life (t1 2). Tumour imaging (CT or MRI) was performed at screening on day 21 ( 7 days) of every even numbered cycle (every 6 weeks) and when disease progression was suspected. Responses were assessed using RECIST version 1.0 (Therasse et al 2000). Safety and tolerability were assessed at baseline and at least every 21 days as evaluated by AEs and changes in laboratory parameters graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0 (National Cancer Institute 2006). Ziv-aflibercept (free or bound to VEGF) in plasma samples was quantified using a validated direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A validated non-quantitative titre-based bridging assay was used to detect anti-ziv-aflibercept antibodies in serum samples. Correlative studies The exploratory objective of the correlative studies was to evaluate changes in erythropoiesis in response to VEGF inhibition. It was hypothesised that VEGF inhibition would result in an increase in haemoglobin via increased hepatic erythropoietin production. Statistical analysis Statistical testing was done to determine whether the ORR was larger than 20 or whether the PFS was greater than 4.5 months. Exact test (one-sided) was used to test the null hypothesis that ORR was ?20 versus the alternative hypothesis that ORR was ?35 . Assuming type I error was not 2.5 a sample of 72 patients would provide 80 power to test the hypothesis using exact binomial test. The calculated sample size of 72 patients would also provide 90 power to test the null hypothesis that median PFS was ?4.5 months versus the alternative hypothesis that PFS was ?6.5 months at one-sided alpha of 2.5 using one sample log-rank test. Safety data were to be summarised. Concentrations of free ziv-aflibercept and adjusted bound ziv-aflibercept: VEGF complex were to be summarised every 21 days over the duration of the study by nominal time point. Noncompartmental parameters were calculated using WinNonlin (version 5.3 Pharsight Corporation Mountain View CA USA) and model 202 (constant infusion) using nominal time points after a single dose of ziv-aflibercept. The noncompartmental analysis was performed over the dosing interval 21 days following the first dose. All analyses used statistical software SAS (version 9.1.3 Cary NC USA). Results Patients This study was closed prematurely because of three confirmed and two suspected but unconfirmed cases of reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS). A total of 42 patients were enrolled from 17 participating sites across the United States and Canada between January 2009 and December 2010. Table 1 summarises the patient demographics. Median age was 61.5 years; 55 were male 86 were Caucasian and 50 had ECOG PS of 0. Safety evaluation Treatment exposure and dose modifications All 42 patients received at least one dose of each of the three study drugs with a median of 92 days of treatment (range 21 288 days). Twenty-seven (64 ) patients completed four or more cycles of the combination treatment. A median of 4.5 (range 1 6) cycles of pemetrexed and 4 (range 1 6) cycles of cisplatin were administered. The median dose intensity was 163.9 (range 110.1 175.5)?mg?m?2 per week for pemetrexed and 24.6 (range 15.3 26.3)?mg?m?2 per week for cisplatin. The delivered dose intensities were 98.3 for pemetrexed and 98.5 for cisplatin. Seventeen (40 ) completed six or more cycles of ziv-aflibercept. The median dose intensity of ziv-aflibercept was 1.97?mg?kg?1 per week close to the planned intensity of 2?mg?kg?1 per week. Reasons for treatment discontinuation were disease progression (33 ) AEs (33 ) and others (34 including withdrawal of consent and investigator request). Seventeen patients had at least one cycle delayed. Eleven patients (26 ) had at least 1 dose modification of ziv-aflibercept 6 (14 ) of pemetrexed and 11 of cisplatin. Adverse events Thirty-five patients (83 ) experienced a treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) of grade 3 or 4 (3 4) and 16 patients (38 ) experienced a serious TEAE. The most common TEAEs were nausea (69 ) fatigue (67 ) and hypertension (57 ). Hypertension neutropaenia and hypokalaemia were the most common grade 3 4 TEAEs in 36 0.14 and 10 of patients respectively. Table 2 summarised the most common TEAEs. Thirty-nine patients (93 ) experienced at least one haematologic abnormality with grade 3 4 in eight patients (19 ) mostly neutropaenia. Every patient experienced at least one abnormal chemistry value with grade 3 4 in 15 (36 ) most commonly hyponatraemia. Seven patients (17 ) died before clinical cutoff of the study. Five died due to disease progression and two due to TEAEs: 1 pneumonia and 1 sepsis. Neurological toxicities Between 26 September 2010 and 30 December2010 five patients experienced neurological symptoms including altered mental status in four slurred speech in one seizure in two and headache in four patients. Three patients had a brain MRI that was consistent with RPLS (Figure 1B). Brain MRI was negative for RPLS in two other patients. The three patients diagnosed with RPLS were all Caucasian women aged 3851 and 72 years respectively. One of the three patients with RPLS entered the study with a history of hypertension. All three patients experienced elevated BP and two patients had reduced CrCL during the therapy: one patient's CrCL decreased by 45 from baseline (141 to 78?ml?min?1) after one cycle and the other's decreased by 20 (64 to 51?ml?min?1) after four cycles. They were diagnosed with RPLS after one two and five cycles of ziv-aflibercept respectively. Two patients recovered from RPLS and one died due to disease progression before RPLS resolution. Pharmacokinetic information was available for two of the three RPLS patients and for one suspected case: systemic concentrations of free ziv-aflibercept were within the range of other patients in the treatment cohort. In the phase I study using the same regimen (N 18) five patients experienced a mild neurocognitive disturbance but no RPLS was diagnosed (Diaz-Padilla et al 2012). Rare cases of RPLS have been observed in the ziv-aflibercept clinical development programme but the rate observed in this study (3 out of 42 7 ) was much higher than previously reported (i.e. 0.5 of 3795 patients treated with ziv-aflibercept as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy ZALTRAP product insert). As a result this study was permanently closed to enrolment. Patients who remained on study were re-consented with updated safety information regarding RPLS in addition to continued close monitoring. Hypertension and renal insufficiency are two risk factors for RPLS. Twenty-four patients (57 ) experienced hypertension (15 grade 3 but no grade 4) during the study 15 of whom had a history of hypertension and 12 had taken antihypertensive medications before entering the study. Eight patients with hypertension also experienced proteinuria. Fourteen patients (33 ) experienced proteinuria (all grades 1 or 2 except a single grade 3) none of whom had a history of renal disease. Fourteen patients experienced CrCL decreases during treatment with six patients having CrCL decreases below 60?ml?min?1 after treatment cycle 4. Efficacy evaluation As the study was closed prematurely there was no statistical power to test the primary hypothesis. Of the 42 patients enrolled 4 patients discontinued early from the study due to AEs (2) consent withdrawal (1) and investigator decision (1). As they did not have a post-baseline tumour assessment they were excluded from the efficacy assessment per predefined statistical analysis plan. Of the 38 patients evaluable for efficacy the median PFS was 5 months (95 CI 4.3 7.1; Figure 1A) and ORR was 26 (95 CI 12 40 ) all of which (10 38) were PR. The disease control rate (PR stable disease) was 89 (26 63 ). A mean reduction of 20 was observed in average percentage changes over time in tumour burden (sum of largest diameters of target lesions) from baseline. Of the 38 patients evaluable for efficacy 22 (58 ) developed hypertension as AE during the study. Seven (7 out of 22 32 ) had a PR compared with only three with no hypertension (3 out of 16 18 ) suggesting that patients who developed hypertension may have had a higher likelihood of response to this treatment. Correlative studies Participation in the correlative studies was optional. Erythropoietin levels were obtained from 16 patients. No trend towards increase in haemoglobin or change in erythropoietin level was seen over time. Pharmacokinetic and antibody evaluation Twenty-three patients participated in blood sampling for PK analysis. Mean observed noncompartmental PK parameters for free ziv-aflibercept are presented in Table 3. The concentration time profiles and PK of free ziv-aflibercept and adjusted bound ziv-aflibercept: VEGF were consistent with results in the phase I study (Diaz-Padilla et al 2012). Mean trough concentrations after the second ziv-aflibercept dose plateaued and remained at ?10?mg?l?1. The mean adjusted bound ziv-aflibercept:VEGF complex Cmax was 7.81?mg?l?1. Trough concentrations plateaued after day 42 and remained constant for the remainder of the study. Two patients had one sample each that was positive in the anti-drug antibody (ADA) assay. One was positive at baseline but did not have an antibody titre drawn at the end of treatment (EOT) visit. This patient completed all six cycles of combination treatment without dose delay reduction or grade 3 4 AEs and had stable disease. The other one was negative at baseline but positive at the EOT visit. This patient experienced anaphylaxis 20?minutes after start of the ziv-aflibercept infusion on day 1 of the second cycle. Study drug was permanently withdrawn. This patient had PK parameters and a concentration time profile different from ADA-negative patients probably because of the ADA formation. Discussion Ziv-aflibercept has been tested as a single agent and in combination with chemotherapy in the treatment of NSCLC (Leighl et al 2010; Ramlau et al 2012). On the basis of activity and safety profile we conducted the current phase II study to explore the efficacy of ziv-aflibercept in the first-line setting. Similar to ECOG 4599 AVAiL and PointBreak trials (Sandler et al 2006; Patel et al 2009a; Reck et al 2009) this study was designed to test a three-drug regimen including an anti-angiogenesis agent in this case ziv-aflibercept cisplatin pemetrexed. In addition maintenance therapy with single-agent ziv-aflibercept was intended to prolong the benefits and delay the development of resistance. This approach was first tested in a phase I dose-escalation study that used the same regimen of ziv-aflibercept cisplatin pemetrexed in 18 patients with advanced solid tumours (Diaz-Padilla et al 2012). Our study population was representative of patients with advanced NSCLC. Overall the median ziv-aflibercept dose intensity was similar to the planned intensity. The delivered dose intensities of pemetrexed cisplatin in this study were over 98 higher than those in the pemetrexed cisplatin arm (94.8 and 95.0 respectively) of the phase III trial (Scagliotti et al 2008). The PK of ziv-aflibercept in this study was characterised as nonlinear and similar to that observed in the phase I study. The mean observed terminal t1 2 was independent of ziv-aflibercept dose. Administration of ziv-aflibercept did not alter pemetrexed PK. Development of ADA was a rare event leading to reduced drug concentration in one patient who experienced anaphylaxis. As with all therapeutic proteins there is a potential for immunogenicity; however severe hypersensitivity reactions are rare. Although this study was terminated early the two co-primary end points ORR of 26 and median PFS of 5 months were in accordance with most historical first-line NSCLC studies (Schiller et al 2002; Scagliotti et al 2008) and slightly less than triplet regimens incorporating another anti-VEGF agent (Sandler et al 2006; Reck et al 2009). However there was no statistical power to test the primary hypothesis that ziv-aflibercept would enhance the efficacy of standard chemotherapy in NSCLC. Biomarkers that can reliably predict the degree of VEGF blockade in vivo are currently not available. Preclinical studies identified increased erythropoietin production and erythropoiesis as a possible surrogate marker of VEGF inhibition as animal data indicate that stringent VEGF inhibition including by ziv-aflibercept modulates erythropoiesis via increased hepatic erythropoietin synthesis (Tam et al 2006). Bevacizumab has also been associated with increased haemoglobin in NSCLC (Riess et al 2012) and reduced anaemia (Sher and Wu 2011). Therefore this study explored whether the increase in haemoglobin observed previously could be reproduced in the presence of chemotherapy and would correlate with anti-angiogenic activity. No trend towards increase in haemoglobin or change in erythropoietin level was found in a small subset of patients. However as in the phase I study a stabilisation of median haemoglobin values for multiple cycles as well as low rate of all-grade anaemia was observed. The result provides some support for the hypothesis that VEGF is a negative regulator of erythropoiesis and its inhibitors may have a role in the management of anaemia. The toxicity profile of this trial was consistent with published data on cisplatin plus pemetrexed and with the known effects of ziv-aflibercept with the exception of a higher than anticipated rate of RPLS (Gadgeel 2012). Hypertension was the third most frequent TEAE and is a known adverse effect of anti-VEGF therapies. However higher response rate was observed among patients who developed hypertension during the treatment than among those who did not in a post hoc analysis. This observation is consistent with data from ECOG 4599 that suggested improved outcomes associated with bevacizumab in patients developing hypertension on therapy (Dahlberg et al 2010). Although cases of RPLS have been observed in other ziv-aflibercept studies the 7 rate observed in this study was much higher. It should be noted that the dose and schedule of ziv-aflibercept in this study at 6?mg?kg?1 every 21 days is different from the one approved in colorectal cancer at 4?mg?kg?1 every 14 days (Van Cutsem et al 2012) although the dose intensity is the same at 2?mg?kg?1 per week. At the recommended phase II dose of 6?mg?kg?1 for ziv-aflibercept no RPLS was reported in the phase I study that used the same regimen (N 7 at that dose level; Diaz-Padilla et al 2012) or in another phase I study of ziv-aflibercept cisplatin docetaxel (N 17 at that dose level; Freyer et al 2012) nor in combination with docetaxel in the VITAL study (N 456 in the combination arm; Ramlau et al 2012). A meta-analysis of safety data from three large placebo-controlled studies reported no RPLS among 1333 patients treated with ziv-aflibercept in combination with standard chemotherapy (Allegra et al 2012). It is likely that the development of RPLS may be regimen dependent rather than dose or schedule dependent. Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome is described as a brain-capillary leak syndrome frequently related to hypertension fluid retention and possibly the cytotoxic effects of immunosuppressive agents on the vascular endothelium (Hinchey et al 1996). Risk factors include female sex hypertension and renal dysfunction (Vaughn et al 2008) as well as anticancer agents: 75 were diagnosed in women and 71 were associated with combination regimens (Marinella and Markert 2009). Bevacizumab and gemcitabine have been most commonly associated with RPLS. Treatment including cisplatin without concomitant anti-VEGF therapy has been associated with RPLS (Ito et al 1998) whereas pemetrexed before this study was not. Consistent with the literature the three cases of RPLS were all diagnosed in women which may be related to an anticancer drug oestrogen interaction inducing altered cerebral vasoreactivity and endothelial dysfunction. Agents that decrease VEGF signalling increases the risk of RPLS (including bevacizumab sunitinib sorafenib and ziv-aflibercept) suggesting a class effect toxicity (Glusker et al 2006). Clinical features of RPLS are neurological symptoms characterized by headaches altered mental status visual disturbances or seizures and systemic signs such as hypertension. Onset is variable ranging from hours to 1 month after completing therapy (Lee et al 2008). Characteristic findings in brain MRI demonstrate bilateral symmetric parieto-occipital subcortical and cortical vasogenic oedema (Bartynski 2008). Removal of the causative agent and treatment of hypertension and renal insufficiency are indicated for RPLS which is usually but not always reversible clinically. In conclusion this phase II study was designed to evaluate ziv-aflibercept in combination with cisplatin and pemetrexed in patients with untreated advanced metastatic non-squamous NSCLC. However three confirmed and two suspected but unconfirmed cases of RPLS led to the early termination of the trial. The reason for the increased incidence of RPLS might be related to declining CrCL and or increased BP. Although ORR and median PFS were in accordance with most historical first-line NSCLC studies this combination of ziv-aflibercept cisplatin pemetrexed will not be further pursued in NSCLC. Future efforts to identify predictive biomarkers of anti-VEGF agents are warranted. This study was supported by Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals.

Determination of SETDB1 gene amplification and its association with RNA and protein overexpression in lung cancer cell lines. (a) Assessment of SETDB1 copy-number by quantitative genomic PCR. Amplification frequency of SETDB1 (evaluated with SYBR Green Bio-Rad Hercules CA USA) was calculated by the standard curve method using the 7900HT SDS program. To define an internal control gene we chose chromosome 1p36.23 because it is the least aneuploid region among our cell lines (PEX19 gene). Primers are available upon request. DNA from normal lung was used as the reference standard. Results are reported as n-fold copy-number increase relative to the PEX19 gene. (b) Fluorescence in situ hybridization for the SETDB1 gene. The UCSC genome browser (http: www.genome.ucsc.edu) was used to select the bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone spanning the 1q21 region for the SETDB1 gene: RP11-42A12. A telomeric BAC clone located in the telomeric 1p36.23 region was used as a control. The BACs were obtained from the BACPAC Resource Center at the Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute (Oakland CA USA). SETDB1 and telomeric probes were labeled with Spectrum Green and Red dUTP (Abbott Wiesbaden Germany) respectively using a CGH Nick Translation Reagent Kit (Abbott Molecular Inc. Des Plaines IL USA). The samples were counterstained with 4'6-diamidino-2-phenylindole in Vectashield antifade solution (Burlingame CA USA). Gene amplification was observed in the interphases of NCI-H1437 NCI-H1395 and DMS-273. Probes were verified to give a single signal on normal commercial lymphocyte metaphase slides (CGH Reagents Abbott). Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (c) and western blot (d) demonstrate higher levels of SETDB1 mRNA and protein (ab12317 Abcam Cambridge UK) respectively in amplified cancer cell lines (H1437 NCI-H1395 and DMS-273) than that in unamplified cells. PCR primers are available upon request. Growth-promoting effects of SETDB1 in lung cancer. (a) Stable downregulation of the SETDB1 gene by short hairpins using two different target sequences for DMS-273 (clones A30 A31 and clone B32-63) and NCI-H1437 (clones A56-B and B46-9). SETDB1 shRNA sequences are available upon request. (b) The short hairpin SETDB1-depleted cells were less viable in the 3-(45-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-25-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay than in the untransfected or scrambled shRNA-transfected cells (P-values obtained by the analysis of variance (ANOVA) test). (c) The colony formation assay showed that DMS-273 and NCI-H1437 cells stably transfected with the shRNA against SETDB1 formed significantly fewer colonies than scrambled shRNA-transfected cells (P-values obtained by the ANOVA test).

Since distant metastases (DMs) are common but the details of the DM distribution and timing in a large cohort have not been described. Methods 629 patients with localized EAC who had TMT or BMT were analyzed. Standard statistical methods were used to define the endpoints. Results The median follow-up time was 37.2 months (interquartile range: 17.8 65.0). Among 356 TMT patients 33 (119) developed DM as their first relapse and among 273 patients with BMT 40 (109) developed DM. 91 (TMT) and 96 (BMT) of DMs were diagnosed within 2 years of local therapy. The most common sites of DMs were: lung distant nodes liver peritoneal cavity bone brain and pleura in the order of frequency. The median overall survival of TMT patients with DM was 10.2 months (95 CI: 7.8 12.7) and that for BMT patients with DM was 7.8 months (95 CI: 5.7 9.9). Conclusions Following TMT or BMT ?33 of patients developed DMs and most DM occurred within 2 years ( 90 ) of local therapy. A clinical model that highly associates with high-risk for DM in TMT-eligible patients prior to surgery is desirable.

Various studies have demonstrated that these compounds possess cytotoxic activities in tumor cell lines of different origin. However there is considerable confusion regarding the molecular basis of phenothiazine-induced cell death. Lung cancer (LC) remains one of the most prevalent and deadly malignancies worldwide despite considerable efforts in the development of treatment strategies especially new targeted therapies. In this work we evaluated the potential utility of phenothiazines in human LC. We show that phenothiazines as single treatment decreased cell viability and induced cell death preferentially in small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) over non small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cell lines. Sensitivity to phenothiazines was not correlated with induction of apoptosis but due to phenothiazine-induced lysosomal dysfunction. Interestingly the higher susceptibility of SCLC cells to phenothiazine-induced cell death correlated with an intrinsically lower buffer capacity in response to disruption of lysosomal homeostasis. Importantly this effect in SCLC occurred despite mutation in p53 and was not influenced by intrinsic sensitivity resistance toward conventional chemotherapeutic agents. Our data thus uncovered a novel context-dependent activity of phenothiazines in SCLC and suggest that phenothiazines could be considered as a treatment regimen of this disease however extended cell line analyses as well as in vivo studies are needed to make such conclusion. small cell lung cancer phenothiazines lysosomal dysfunctions Phenothiazines are a family of heterocyclic compounds whose clinical utility includes treatment of psychiatric disorders for example schizophrenia.1 In this setting the therapeutically relevant targets of phenothiazines are believed to be neurotransmitter receptors in particular the dopamine D2 receptor (D2R).2 However an array of putative cellular targets have additionally been described for phenothiazines ranging from calmodulin (CaM) to lipid membranes suggesting that the effect of these compounds likely extend beyond their impact on neuroendocrine signaling.3 Notably various studies have demonstrated that phenothiazines possess cytotoxic activities especially in established tumor cell lines.4 However there is considerable confusion regarding the molecular basis of phenothiazine-induced cell death and numerous hypotheses including CaM antagonism5 membrane fluidization6 and disruption of mitosis7 have been proposed. Lung cancer (LC) remains one of the most deadly malignancies worldwide8 despite considerable effort in the development of treatment strategies especially new targeted therapies. In parallel there has been a recent revival of interest in the use of old' FDA-approved drugs for new indications. In this work we evaluated the potential utility of phenothiazines in LC. We show that phenothiazines induced cell death preferentially in small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) over non small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cell lines. In this context cytotoxicity was due to phenothiazine-induced lysosomal dysfunction and the higher susceptibility of SCLC cells correlated with an intrinsically lower buffer capacity in response to disruption of lysosomal homeostasis. Importantly this effect in SCLC occurred despite mutation in p53 and was not influenced by intrinsic sensitivity resistance toward the conventional chemotherapeutic agents for example cisplatin etoposide or gemcitabine. Our data thus uncovered a novel context-dependent antitumor action of phenothiazines in SCLC. Results Single-drug treatment with phenothiazines induced cytotoxicity preferentially in human SCLCs Phenothiazines have been reported to induce apoptosis in tumor cells of different origin.34 9 Here we evaluated the potential therapeutic utility of phenothiazines in a panel of human SCLC and NSCLC cell lines. At a concentration of 10??M which is in the range of concentration achievable in the plasma of patients without eliciting significant adverse side effects10 phenothiazines were overtly cytotoxic analyzed as reduction in cell viability in most of the tested SCLC cell lines while NSCLC cell lines were generally less responsive (Figures 1a c Table 1). The hyper-responsiveness of SCLC to phenothiazines was not recapitulated when the chemotherapeutic drugs cisplatin etoposide and gemcitabine were used11 as comparable decrease in cell viability was observed in SCLC and NSCLC cells (Supplementary Figure S1). Moreover our results clearly show that the sensitivity to phenothiazine-induced decrease in cell viability in SCLC is not substantially influenced by growth pattern site of isolation prior exposure to conventional chemotherapies and occurs despite mutation in the tumor suppressor p53 (Supplementary Table S1). To further verify the preferential activity of phenothiazines in SCLC we compared the sensitivity of four phenothiazine compounds (trifluoperazine dihydrochloride (TFP) fluphenazine dihydrochloride (FPZ) triflupromazine hydrochloride (TFPZ) and promazine hydrochloride (PZ)) over a range of concentrations in the SCLC cell line H82 and in the NCSLC cell line U-1810 (b upper panel). We also assessed the dose-dependent cytotoxicity of TFP analyzed as decrease in cell viability in several additional SCLC (H69 U-1285 U-1906 and U-2020) and NSCLC (A549 H125 and H1299) cell lines (b lower panel). These analyses confirmed that SCLC cells were more sensitive to phenothiazines than NSCLC cells (b). Importantly the cell viability of primary fetal lung WI-38 fibroblast was less affected by phenothiazines at concentrations that caused significant cytotoxicity in SCLC cells illustrating a potential therapeutic window for phenothiazines in SCLC (Figures 1a and c). The increased sensitivity of SCLC cells to phenothiazines was also evidenced by increased cell death and growth arrest after treatment with these agents (). Thus 10??M TFP induced a prominent impairment in cell division capacity in SCLC cells while in NSCLC cells 20??M TFP was needed to significantly affect proliferation (Figures 2a and b). Analysis of cell cycle kinetics of SCLC cells (H69 and H82) revealed that 10??M TFP caused a time-dependent cell cycle arrest in late S and G2 M phases whereas such changes in cell cycle were not observed for NSCLC (U-1810; c). Taken together our data demonstrate that phenothiazines preferentially decrease the viability and growth of human SCLC.\nLabels: [Thyroid_Cancer, Colon_Cancer, Lung_Cancer]\nReply with one label only.", "assistant": "Lung_Cancer"}

ROS Assay The generation of ROS was assessed in Huh-7 or SMMC-7721 cells with the 2?7?-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) (Invitrogen) probe which is hydrolyzed within cells to non-fluorescent 2?7?-dichlorodihydrofluorescin (DCFH). DCFH can be oxidized to the fluorescent 2?7?-dichlorofluorescein (DCF) by hydroxyl radicals peroxynitrite and nitric oxide. Briefly Huh-7 or SMMC-7721 cells were seeded in a 96-well plate. Overnight the cells were incubated with different concentration of luteoloside for 8 h then reacted with 10 µM DCFH-DA at 37 C for 20 min. Or the cells were incubated with NAC (10 mM) H2O2 (100 µM) diamide (10 mM) or BSO (100 µM) for 4 h followed by 50 µM luteoloside for 4 h 24 . DCF was determined at ?ex? ?490 and ?em? ?520 nm on a Synergy H4 microplate reader (BioTek Winooski VT). Furthermore ROS were measured with a Leica DMI4000B inverted fluorescence (Leica Wetzlar Germany). Protein Extraction and Western Blotting The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad Hercules CA). The membrane was blocked with 5 non-fat milk and incubated with rabbit anti-LC3 polyclonal antibody (pAb) (Novus Biologicals) (2 µg ml) rabbit anti-Beclin 1 pAb (Abcam) (3 µg ml) rabbit anti-NLRP3 pAb (Novus Biologicals) (1?1000) rabbit anti-caspase-1 (p10) pAb (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (1?1000) rabbit anti-IL-1? pAb (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (1?1000) or rabbit anti-?-actin pAb (Bioworld Technology) (1?5000). The proteins were detected with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Pierce). Cell Proliferation Assay The cell proliferation assay was conducted as previously described by us 22 . Scratch-wound Assay Scratch-wound assay was conducted as previously described by us 22 . The migration of cells into the wound was monitored in multiple wells using a CellVoyager CV1000 confocal scanner system (Yokogawa Electronic Tokyo Japan) with an Olympus UPLSApo 10 2 10 0.4 Dry ? 0.17 26.5 WD 3.1 plan super apochromat objective lens. The images were acquired every 0.5 hour for 48 hours (or every hour for 72 hours). The images shown represent 0 and 48 hour (or 0 and 72 hour). In Vitro Migration and Invasion Assays Assays were performed as described previously by Yao et al 25 . Xenograft Model and Treatments Two different mouse models were used to observe in vivo effect of Luteoloside on HCC cells. For the subcutaneous model the mice (male BALB c-nu nu 6 weeks old) were anesthetized using 1 sodium pentobarbital (0.2 ml 20 g body weight Sigma Chemical) as described by us previously 22 . The SMMC-7721 cells (2 106 cells) were suspended in 200 µl serum-free DMEM and subcutaneously injected into the right upper flank of each mouse. Two weeks after the cells were injected when tumors were observable the animals were equally divided into two groups (ten per group). The first group received only 0.2 ml of vehicle material by gavage daily and served as a control group. The second group of animals received luteoloside (2 mg kg body weight; equivalent to a dose of 6.5 mg m2 in patients) in vehicle respectively for 4 weeks. Body weight was measured every 4 days to adjust the drug dosage. The tumors were measured using digital calipers every 3 to 4 days after they reached a volume of 100 mm3 and tumor volumes were calculated as described: V (cm3)? ?Width2 (cm2) Length (cm) 2. At the termination of the experiment the mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and the tumors were weighed immediately after dissection. For lung metastasis experiments 1 106 SMMC-7721 cells were suspended in 100 µl PBS and injected into the tail veins of each mouse (male BALB c-nu nu 6 weeks old) 26 . Then the animals were equally divided into two groups (ten per group). The first group received only 0.2 ml of vehicle material by gavage daily and served as a control group. The second group of animals received Luteoloside (2 mg kg body weight) in vehicle respectively for 8 weeks. Body weight was measured every 4 days to adjust the drug dosage. At the termination of the experiment the mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and their lungs were removed and subjected to hematoxylin eosin (H E) staining. This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The protocol was approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of the University of Jiangsu Normal University (Permit Number: 13-0221). All surgery was performed under sodium pentobarbital anesthesia and all efforts were made to minimize suffering. Statistical Analysis Data are presented as means SEM and comparisons were made using Student s t test. A probability of 0.05 or less was considered statistically significant. Results Luteoloside Inhibits the Proliferation of HCC Cells in vitro We first determined whether luteoloside inhibits the proliferation of human HCC cells. We found that luteoloside significantly inhibited cell proliferation in all six-cell lines in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 1B 1C). The results suggest that luteoloside has promising antihepatoma activity. Luteoloside Inhibits the Migration and Invasion of HCC Cells in vitro Luteoloside significantly decreased the migration of Huh-7 and SMMC-7721 cells compared with the control groups (Fig. 2A 2H; Supplementary Movies 1 4). Transwell assays without Matrigel demonstrated that luteoloside could significantly inhibit migration of Huh-7 cells when compared with control groups (Fig. 2I 2J 2M). Transwell assays with Matrigel showed that the invasive capacities of Huh-7 cells which were treated with luteoloside were significantly inhibited compared with the control cells (Fig. 3K 3L 3N). These results indicate that luteoloside can significantly inhibit HCC cells migration and invasion in vitro. .0089961.g002 Luteoloside inhibits migration and invasion of HCC cells. The migration of cells into the wound was monitored in multiple wells using a CellVoyager CV1000 confocal scanner system. The images were acquired every 0.5 hour for 48 hours (Huh-7 cells) or every hour for 72 hours (SMMC-7721 cells) (see Supplemental Movies 1 4). The images shown represent 0 hour (A B E F) 48 hours (C D) and 72 hours (G H).

Luteoloside has no Apoptotic Effects on HCC Cells Huh-7 and SMMC-7721 cells were treated with luteoloside for 24 h and caspase-3 7 was measured. The results showed that caspase-3 7 activity was not significantly different between luteoloside-treated cells and control cells when added 5102050100 150 or 200 µM luteoloside respectively (Fig. S1A S1B). Similar results were obtained by analyzing changes in nuclear fragmentation (Fig. S1C) and condensation (Fig. S1D) in cells. These results indicated that luteoloside has no apoptotic effects on Huh-7 and SMMC-7721 cells. Luteoloside does not Affect Autophagy Autophagic cell death (also known as Type II programmed cell death to distinguish it from apoptosis or Type I programmed cell death) has been described as a distinct form of cell death that differs from other death mechanism such as apoptosis and necrosis. Next we investigated whether luteoloside can induce autophagy in HCC cells. Beclin 1 and LC3 (microtubule-associated protein 1A 1B-light chain 3) play a pivotal role in mammalian autophagy. Beclin 1 is involved in both the signaling pathway activating autophagy and in the initial step of autophagosome formation 27 . LC3 comprises both a soluble LC3-I and a lapidated form called LC3-II. LC3-II correlates with autophagy being recruited into autophagosomes. Various types of stressors up-regulate LC3 and promote the conjugation of its cytosolic form LC3-I to phosphatidylethanolamine to constitute the autophagosome-specific LC3-II which is so far considered the most reliable marker of autophagy 27 28 . Huh-7 and SMMC-7721 cells were treated with luteoloside for 48 h and the levels of LC3 and Beclin 1 proteins of different treatment groups were determined. The results showed that LC3 protein level was not significantly different between luteoloside-treated cells and control cells when added 25 µM or 50 µM luteoloside respectively. Similar results were obtained by analyzing changes in levels of Beclin 1 (Fig. S2). These results indicated that luteoloside has no autophagic effects on Huh-7 and SMMC-7721 cells. Luteoloside Reduces Intracellular ROS Accumulation ROS and cellular oxidant stress have long been associated with cancer 29 . Flavonoids are well known as ROS scavengers. As luteoloside is a kind of flavonoid isolated from Chinese herb 30 we investigated whether the intracellular ROS is part of the mechanism by which luteoloside suppress the proliferation migration and invasion potential of HCC cells. We found that luteoloside could significantly decrease the ROS level of Huh-7 and SMMC-7721 cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A 3B). N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) is a ROS-specific inhibitor 31 . NAC was shown to be capable of suppressing the ROS production in Huh-7 and SMMC-7721 cells (Fig. 3C). When the cells were pretreated with 10 mM NAC for 4 h then treated with 50 µM luteoloside for 4 h the ROS level was significantly lower than the cells which treated with 10 mM NAC only (Huh-7 cells P? ?0.0208; SMMC-7721 cell P? ?0.0224). H2O2 diamide and BSO are all ROS inducers 4 . Treatment with 100 µM H2O2 10 mM diamide or 100 µM BSO showed similar effects resulted in an increase in ROS levels compared with control (Fig. 3D 3F). The results showed that H2O2 diamide and BSO could significantly increase the ROS level of Huh-7 and SMMC-7721 cells compared the control group (Fig. 3D 3F). However after a prolonged time when the cells were treated with 50 µM luteoloside for 4 h the amount of ROS could significantly decrease (Fig. 3D 3F). Furthermore the ROS in Huh-7 cells were monitored using a fluorescence microscope. We also found that luteoloside could significantly decrease the ROS level of Huh-7 cells (Fig. 3G).

{"system": "You are a medical text classifier. Choose exactly one label.", "user": "Text: More sophisticated models with splines or other functions such as those illustrated in publications cited in only require the application of different bases for deriving C but are nevertheless represented by 3). 2.2. Extension to nonlinear exposure response relationships The extension to the nonlinear case presents further complexities as anticipated earlier. The model in (1) can be extended by defining an additional exposure response function f(x) to express the potentially nonlinear exposure response curve along the dimension of the predictor. An intuitive generalization of (1) is: (4) with f(x) as the standard exposure response function. However the function f(x) w(?) in 4) previously proposed 1119 is not easily represented as a linear combination of basis variables and generates models that are not linear in their parameters and thus require ad hoc optimization routines. More importantly this representation is based on the strong assumption of independency between f(x) and w(?) namely that the exposure response shape is the same at each lag ? and vice versa that the lag structure is the same at each value of x. This assumption can be relaxed by expressing s(xt) as a truly bivariate function with the more flexible representation: (5) Here the bidimensional function f w(x?) is defined as the exposure lag response function and models simultaneously the exposure response curve along x and lag response curve along ? namely an exposure lag response surface. Differently from 4) the exposure lag response function in 5) can be expressed as a linear combination of basis variables and related parameters through a special tensor product. As anticipated earlier Armstrong 23 proposed the same approach for time series data within the DLNM framework generalizing this tensor product parameterization through the concept of cross-basis. Specifically two sets of basis functions are independently chosen to represent f(x) and w(?) respectively. The cross-basis is the bidimensional space of functions obtained by the combination of the two sets integrated over the lag dimension and represents the core of DLNMs. The algebraic representation has been previously presented 24 and a revised version is proposed here. Briefly the simpler lag-basis for DLMs in 3) can be extended by choosing an additional basis with dimension vx for representing f(x). The application of the related basis functions to the vector of exposure history qxt obtained by 2) generates a (L ? ?0 1) vx matrix Rxt. Let Axt be: (6) with 1v as a v-dimensional vector of 1's and C defined in 3). The cross-basis function s(xt;?) can be defined as (7) In this case the dimension of the cross-basis is determined by the product of the dimensions of the bases for the two spaces and the association is expressed through vx v? values W and related parameters ?. The cross-basis function s(xt) represents the integral of f w(x?) over the interval ?0L cumulating the contributions of events representing the exposure history. In spite of the relatively complex algebraic form the definition of cross-basis and the specification of DLNMs only amount to the choice of the bases for the functions f(x) and w(?). These can be independently selected between several options such as splines linear threshold or piecewise constant (step) functions. The DLNM modeling class comprises the simpler DLMs from Section 2.1. For example the bidimensional exposure lag response function f w(x?) in 5) reduces to a non-linear function for un-weighted cumulative exposure f(x) c when w(?) is a constant function c and to the lag response function x w(?) in (1) when f(x) is simply an linear function of the untransformed x. The model proposed by Berhane and colleagues 20 can be written in the form of 6) 7) when both f(x) and w(?) are cubic B-splines. 2.3. Estimation and prediction Although the lag-basis and cross-basis functions in (1) (3) and (5) (7) involve a nonstandard parameterization in terms of exposure histories DLMs and DLNMs do not require specialized estimation procedures. The association is entirely expressed by the vx v? parameters ? of the cross-basis values W. The computation of the exposure history in (2) can be extended to all N observations with x measured at time t producing an N (L ? ?0 1) matrix of exposure histories Q. The matrix of transformed variables W in (3) and (7) is consequently derived. This matrix can be included in the design matrix of standard regression models to estimate the parameters ?. In the completely parametric development proposed here the number of coefficients vx v? represents the degrees of freedom (df) used to model the association. Inference on the parameters ? and interpretation of the estimated association is aided by the prediction of specific risk measures. For simpler DLMs that assume a linear exposure response relationship this step reduces to the computation of a series of estimated risk contributions at lag ?p with ?0 ? ?p ? L and the associated (co)variance matrix . The series of risk contributions is provided by (8) with Cp obtained from the vector of lag ?p used for prediction by applying the same basis functions for w(?) used for estimation. These estimated risk contributions compose the lag response curve and can be interpreted using either a forward or backward perspective. Namely represents the risk contribution at time t ?p in the future from a unit increase in exposure x at time t or the contribution from a unit increase in exposure x occurring at time t ? ?p in the past to a given risk measured at time t. The estimated risk contributions associated with different exposure increases are easily derived. The equations in (8) only apply to DLMs with lag-bases as defined in (3). For DLNMs the association is allowed to vary nonlinearly in the space of x. Moreover the specification in (5) (7) allows the lag-response curve to change depending on the level of the exposure. The prediction of risk contributions corresponding to a specific exposure intensity xp at lag ?p involves a more complex procedure. First let be the (L ? ?0 1)-dimensional vector of exposure history with constant exposure xp. The related matrices and are derived from (6) substituting qxt and C with and Cp by applying the same two sets of basis functions for f w(x?) chosen for estimation. The exposure-specific risk contributions and associated (co)variance matrix are provided by (9) The estimated risk contributions may be interpreted as a lag-response curve similar to in (8) but this time associated with a specific exposure level xp instead of a unit increase. These measures may be used to define a grid of predicted risk contributions defined within the ranges of the exposure x and the lag ? thus obtaining a bi-dimensional representation of the association. From this grid besides above it is also possible to derive the vector of lag-specific risk contributions expressing the exposure-response curve for lag ?p. As noted in Section 2.2 the truly bivariate definition of (7) allows both the lag-response curve and exposure-response curve defined by and respectively to change depending on the specific exposure and lag values xp and ?p. The grid is interpreted as a risk surface along x and ? representing the exposure lag response. In addition predictions in (8) (9) may be extended to a generic exposure history qh. Substituting it into in (9) provides the vector of lag-specific risk contributions for each exposure that occurred within the lag period. The overall cumulative effect of such exposure history with associated (co)variance matrix may be computed with: (10) The Equation (10) can be used to estimate the predicted cumulative risk for a given pattern of exposure qh. This method can also be applied to investigate how the risk progressively evolves along an exposure profile computing the cumulative risk at each time associated with the time-varying exposure history qh. 2.4. Identifiability and constraints The tensor product structure of the cross-basis defined in (5) (7) poses some identifiability issues. In particular each of the vx basis variables in R is multiplied by each of the v? basis variables in C. If an intercept is included in f(x) the related matrix of cross-basis variables W is not of full rank and the parameters of the regression model are not identifiable even when a common intercept is not included. Therefore the cross-basis in (7) should always be defined without an intercept in the basis functions for x. Also these basis functions can be centered on a specific exposure value x0 which will represent the reference for the risk summaries computed by (8) (10). The bidimensional shape of the exposure lag response can be constrained to follow a prespecified pattern. In particular a priori assumptions on the lag structure can be imposed through functional constraints on the basis for the space of ?. Left and right constraints on the extremes of the supporting interval ?0 L are particularly meaningful for smooth functions. A left constraint can be imposed by excluding the intercept from the basis. This step will force the lag response curve to predict a null risk at the beginning of the lag period. A right constraint on a B-splines basis can be produced by excluding specific basis variables as previously described for linear exposure response relationships 17. The constraint produces a smooth dependency which approaches a null risk at the end of the lag period. Such constraints are particularly useful in the presence of sparse data in order to limit the flexibility of the model under specific assumptions about the lag response curve. However biases can be introduced if these assumptions are not met. Additional information is provided in Section D1 of the supporting information. The functional constraints discussed in this section can be specified without introducing customized optimization methods for estimating the parameters ? in (3) (7). More sophisticated methods are required for example to constrain the lag response curve to be non-negative in the whole lag period L. These approaches have been previously proposed for linear dependencies 141718 and introduce further complexities in the bidimensional context of DLNMs. This development is not pursued here. 2.5. Model selection and inferential procedures The framework described in Sections 2.1 2.2 includes a fairly large number of models defined by different functions for each of the two dimensions and by different choices regarding each function such as number and location of knots in splines. This raises the issue of selecting the optimal model for describing the exposure lag response association. Previous studies on temporal dependencies have proposed selection procedures on the basis of profile likelihood 15 AIC 141620 or BIC 17. Simulation studies seems to indicate a better performance of AIC when compared with BIC in this context 18 a result consistent with unpublished simulations performed on time series data for DLNMs. Inference on the models illustrated in the previous sections primarily focuses on the specification of confidence intervals for the risk measures in Section 2.3 and on the definition of tests for a set of null hypotheses. Confidence intervals for lag response curves exposure response curves and cumulative risks obtained through and can be easily derived from the diagonal of the related (co)variance matrices in (8) (10) assuming a multivariate normal distribution of the estimators. Regarding hypothesis testing two null hypotheses are particularly relevant in this framework. The first one postulates a linear exposure response relationship namely H0 : f(x) x. The second one assumes a constant risk namely H0 : w(?) c. Tests on constrained models can be also defined. The assumption of independency is not easily tested as the form in (4) cannot be expressed as a model linear in its parameters. However defining general inferential procedures in this setting is not straightforward. First the null hypotheses H0 : f(x) x and H0 : w(?) c are not independent and an incorrect assumption about the association in one dimension may bias the test estimator for the hypothesis related to the other space as previously reported 19. In addition estimates are usually conditional on a posteriori selection of a best-fitting model based on the selection methods discussed before. Under these conditions the estimators for the (co)variance matrices in (8) (10) are likely to underestimate the true sampling (co)variance and the distribution of the test statistics may be different from that assumed unconditional on the selection procedure. This may generate undercoverage of confidence intervals and inflated type I error for tests 1727. Given these complexities a general framework for hypothesis testing embedded in the model selection procedure is not provided here. An assessment through simulations of the performance of estimators generated by AIC and BIC-selected models will be presented in. Specifically simulations will provide an empirical evaluation of the ability of the information criteria to identify the correct model between those defining the null or alternative hypotheses about linearity and constant effects and measures of performance such as bias coverage and root mean square error. 3. An application The conceptual and statistical framework of DLNMs described in extended beyond time series data is general and applicable in different study designs. As an illustrative example I propose here an application in survival analysis of time-to-event data. This represents one of the most complex settings as the temporal pattern of risk is produced by exposure histories that vary during the follow-up of each subject. Specifically the methodology is used to investigate the association between occupational exposure to radon and mortality for lung cancer. The analysis is based on data from the Colorado Plateau uranium miners cohort already used in previous methodological contributions 121520. Section A of the supporting information provides a list of the main steps to replicate the analysis in other real-life examples. 3.1. Data The cohort data used in this example were collected by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Detailed information on the cohort is given elsewhere 12. Briefly subjects were eligible to enter the cohort if they worked in mines within the Colorado Plateau area between 1950 and 1960 and provided demographic personal and occupational information during their working period. Vital status and cause of death were ascertained by linkage with different sources. The data used in this example refer to the follow-up of the cohort on December 311982 including 3347 subjects and 258 lung cancer deaths. Exposure data available in the data set include cumulative measures of radon and smoking in 5-year age intervals. The radon exposure history for each subject expressed in working-level months (WLM) was reconstructed by linking employment information with measured or predicted levels in each mine in each year. The smoking history expressed in the number of cigarettes packs 100 was reported by each subject during his working period and assumed constant after the last reporting age. A summary of the data is provided in Table I. Table I Descriptive statistics of the Colorado Plateau uranium miners cohort. The data included here refer to the follow-up on December 31 1982.

Modeling strategy For this illustrative example the analysis is performed through a Cox proportional-hazard model with time-varying covariates by using age as the time axis. Effect measures are reported as a hazard ratio (HR). The model is represented by the following: (11) where the log-hazard log h(t) is expressed as a sum of baseline log-hazard log h0(t) and contributions of additional covariates. These comprise cross-basis functions sx(xt) and sz(zt) for radon and smoking respectively as defined in (1) (7) and a linear term for calendar time u in order to control for secular trends in lung cancer risk not accounted for by the delayed effects of the two exposures. Radon is the exposure of interest and is modeled with different combinations of bases for f(x) and w(?) in the cross-basis sx(xt). Given the limited information on smoking histories in this analysis the cross-basis sz(zt) is a priori defined with a natural cubic B-spline with one knot at the median of 2.5 yearly packs 100 for the exposure response and a step function with a single cut-off at lag 20 for the lag structure with lag period 2 40 years. However different cross-basis functions can be applied. The model spends 5 df controlling for confounders and a different amount for modeling the effect of radon depending on the chosen cross-basis sx(xt). Modeling exposure lag response associations in time-to-event data assumes the definition of an extended version of continuous time-varying predictors namely the varying exposure history for each subject at the ages he contributes to different risk sets 28. The lag scale is chosen as years with lag 0 identifying the exposure during the last year. The lag period is fixed at 2 40 assuming no effect of exposure after 40 years and in the last 2 years consistently with previous analyses. Multiple exposure histories are computed for each subject at the ages he contributed to each risk set given his exposure profile reconstructed from the 5-year periods. This step produced matrices of exposure histories Qx and Qz for radon and smoking respectively as defined in (2). These matrices are used to specify the lag-bases or cross-bases matrices Wx and Wz from (3) (7) included in the design matrix of the Cox model. Additional information is provided in the Section B of the supporting information. The functions f(x) and w(?) composing sx(xt) for the model candidates are selected a priori among linear constant piecewise constant functions and quadratic B-splines with 36 models in total. Specifically the three cut-offs of a piecewise constant function and combinations of 01 or 2 knots for B-splines are placed at quartiles for the dimension of x corresponding to 26.760.2 and 122.2 WLM year and at 13.320 or 26.6 lags for the dimension of ?. Also in alternative parameterizations of w(?) the intercept is excluded in the B-spline bases left-constraining the smooth lag response curve to start from a null risk at lag 2. This a priori assumption reasonably follows the hypothesis that the risk associated with past exposures smoothly increases from zero starting from lag 2. Model selection is based on AIC and BIC adapted to survival analysis given by the following: (12) where is the log-likelihood of the fitted model k is the number of total df and d is the number of uncensored events. The best-fitting model (11) is chosen by minimizing AIC or BIC in (12). Both criteria apply a multiplicative constant to the number of parameters for penalizing more complex models. In particular the penalty of BIC (equal to log(d)) is usually higher and tends to select simpler models. 3.3. Results for distributed lag models Results for simple DLMs assuming a linear radon mortality relationship on the log scale are illustrated first. Table II presents models with different functions w(?) as defined in (3). Specifically model 1 is specified by a constant (intercept only) function producing a lag-basis identical to the traditional index of unweighted cumulative exposure; model 2 is an example of a DLM with a piecewise constant function; the best-fitting B-spline models with and without intercept specified by a single knot at 13.3 lags are reported as models 3 and 4 respectively. The fit of the various options is expressed by AIC and BIC with the best performance achieved by model 1 for both criteria. This model assigns the same importance to the exposures experienced ? lags earlier in defining the risk for a given time. The specification of more flexible functions with more df does not seem to improve the fit. Table II Functions f(x) and w(?)

Figure 1 shows the lag response curves estimated from models 12 and 4. The curves are composed of a series of estimated contributions to the risk of mortality for lung cancer at each lag ? associated with an increase of 100 WLM year in radon exposure with defined in (8). The results can be interpreted following the scheme described in Section 2.3. By using a forward perspective represents the HR contribution from a unit increase in exposure experienced at t to the subsequent risk at t ? with ? 2 40 years. Alternatively adopting a backward perspective the same summary is interpreted as the HR contribution from a unit increase in exposure experienced at t ? ? to the overall risk at t. Model 4 predicts a maximum increase in risk at lag 11 with a HR of 1.042 (95 CI: 1.031 1.052) compared with the constant HR of 1.031 (95 CI: 1.025 1.036) estimated from model 1. Figure 1 Hazard ratio (HR) of lung cancer mortality associated with radon exposure to 100 WLM year in the lag period of 0 40 years. The figure shows the lag response curves estimated from models 4 (with 95 CI)2 and 1 as specified in Table II. Data from the Colorado Plateau uranium miners cohort. The better performance of model 1 seems to indicate that the hypothesis of constant risk H0 : w(?) c is supported by the data. Also the lag response curve from model 4 in Figure 1 does not suggest a decrease in risk at longer lags although the confidence intervals are relatively wide in this part of the lag period. 3.4. Results for distributed lag non-linear models The results illustrated in Section 3.3 are dependent on the strong assumption of a log-linear relationship between radon exposure and lung cancer mortality. The analysis can be repeated with more flexible DLNMs which can describe simultaneously nonlinear exposure response relationships and lag structures through the specification of a cross-basis in (5) (7). The definition of DLNMs involves a higher number of potential models obtained by different combinations of bases for the functions f(x) and w(?). The second part of Table II only reports models with the same choices for w(?) used in DLM and with f(x) specified as another piecewise constant function and the B-spline providing the best fit with one knot at 60.2 WLM year. Overall the best-fitting option for both AIC and BIC is model 8 with a B-spline for both f(x) and w(?). This model uses 9 df in total for expressing the bidimensional association. The hypothesis H0 : f(x) x of a linear radon-mortality dependency is not supported by the data as all the DLNMs show a substantial decrease in both AIC and BIC when compared with simpler DLMs. In particular the comparison of the best-fitting model 8 representing f w(x?) with model 4 representing x w(x?) indicates that the 6 additional df substantially improve the fit. Similarly the hypothesis H0 : w(?) c of a constant risk along lags previously suggested when evaluating DLMs is not supported either. The comparison of model 8 with model 5 representing f(x) c indicates a better fit of the former. Interestingly this result is the opposite of what was suggested in Section 3.3 revealing how imposing a wrong assumption about the relationship in one dimension induces spurious results in the other space compromising the analysis of the association. The interpretation of results from DLNMs relies on a bidimensional representation of the exposure lag response association. This is achieved by computing the risk contributions over a grid defined in the range of the exposure x and the lag ? applying (9). This bidimensional dependency is depicted in the two top panels of Figure 2 showing the predicted HR surfaces from models 8 and 6 in the range 0 250 WLM and 0 40 lags. The graphs show an initial increase in risk along lags peaking at approximately 10 years after the exposure and then decreasing and apparently disappearing after about 30 years independent of the exposure levels. The inspection of the panels along the dimension of x reveals the nonlinear radon-mortality dependency with the risk increasing steadily up to 50 WLM year and then flattening out. The shape of the HR surfaces unveils the different assumptions underlying the choices of bases for functions f(x) and w(?) namely B-splines and piecewise constant functions. Figure 2 Hazard ratio (HR) of lung cancer mortality associated with radon exposure in the range 0 250 WLM year and lag period 0 40 years. The figure shows 3-D graphs of the exposure lag response association on a grid of exposure lag values (from model 8 top left and model 6 top right) lag response curves for radon exposure of 100 WLM year (from models 8 with 95 CI and model 6 bottom left) and exposure response curves at lag 15 (from models 8 with 95 CI and models 6 and 4 bottom right). The models are described in Table II. Data from the Colorado Plateau uranium miners cohort. Although the 3-D representation offered by the top panels in Figure 2 provides an overview of the bidimensional association it is still limited for inferential purposes as the uncertainty in the estimate is not reported. In order to extend the interpretation the analysis can focus on the risk along ? predicted for specific exposure intensities or alternatively the risk along x for specific lags namely the vectors and from Section 2.3. These dependencies are represented by slices cut on the bidimensional risk surface along the appropriate dimension. The bottom panels of Figure 2 report the lag response curve corresponding to an exposure level of 100 WLM year and the exposure response curve for lag 15 from both Models 8 and 6 together with 95 confidence intervals for the former. These curves correspond to the two bold lines in the 3-D plots. The bottom-left panel is interpreted similarly to the DLM in Figure 1 as the specific risk contributions composing the lag response curve but this time associated with a specific exposure xp 100 WLM year. The curve estimated from model 8 peaks at lag 11 with an HR of 1.21 (95 CI: 1.16 1.26) and both models 8 and 6 suggest that the risk disappears after 30 35 years. The B-spline for w(?) in model 8 is left-constrained by the lack of an intercept forcing the smoothed lag response curve to start from a null risk at lag 2. The best fit of Model 8 if compared with model 7 which includes the intercept seems to support this hypothesis. The bottom-right panel shows instead the risk contributions at ?p 15 for different exposure intensities and is interpreted as the exposure response at t from exposures experienced at t ? 15 (backward perspective) or the exposure response contributions at t 15 from exposures experienced at year t (forward perspective). Although models 8 and 6 adopt different bases for functions f(x) and w(?) the estimates of the predicted risk along x and ? are consistent showing a radon-mortality relationship that is markedly nonlinear and nonconstant in time. These measures of risk are extended in Figure 3 reporting estimates from model 8 for different exposure and lag values. A right-constrained version of Model 8 is discussed in Section D.1 and illustrated in Figure S2 of the supporting information. Figure 3 Hazard ratio (HR) of lung cancer mortality associated with radon exposure in the range 0 250 WLM year and lag period 0 40 years. The figure shows lag response curves for radon exposure of 2050100 and 200 WLM year (left) and exposure response curves at lag 51015 and 20 (right) estimated from model 8 as specified in Table II. Data from the Colorado Plateau uranium miners cohort. Interestingly even though model 8 is produced from the flexible definition in (5) (7) Figures 2 and 3 suggest that the assumption of independency holds here with shapes of the exposure-response and lag-response curves at different values of ?p and xp respectively being proportional and the maximum HR constantly experienced at lag 11. This result reinforces the fact that the cross-basis representation based on a truly bivariate exposure lag response function f w(x?) may appropriately describe the specific independency case defined by the simpler representation f(x) w(?) in (4). 3.5. Prediction for specific exposure histories The flexible modeling approach described here can be applied to predict the overall cumulative risk from (10) for a specific exposure history qh as outlined in Section 2.3. Table III illustrates the predicted HR from four different models in five alternative exposure scenarios. This approach previously proposed 17 provides clear and interpretable risk summaries from complex models in the presence of varying exposure patterns. The first two scenarios refer to a constant radon exposure of 20 and 100 WLM year respectively in the past 10 years. As expected simple DLMs (models 1 and 4) predict a similar risk but substantially lower than the two DLNMs with a B-spline for f(x). In particular model 5 extends model 1 by allowing a nonlinear dependency for the unweighted cumulative exposure estimating a slightly lower risk when compared with the more flexible model 8 already described. The third scenario extends the exposure to 20 WLM year in the previous 20 years while the fourth one assumes that a 10-year exposure to the same intensity ceased 10 years before. The comparative assessment of the four models is similar to the first two examples. The last scenario considers the risk of more remote exposures occurring 30 39 years ago. Interestingly models 1 and 5 provide identical estimates to the fourth scenario as the risk of past exposures is assumed constant along the whole lag period. Model 8 instead predicts no excess in lung cancer in the last scenario given at least 30 years passed from the last exposure to radon a lag period for which the lag response curve in Figure 2 (bottom-left panel) displays a null risk.

{"system": "You are a medical text classifier. Choose exactly one label.", "user": "Text: cells treated with thiaminase are consistent with inhibition of BCKDH complex pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and transketolase inhibition. However inhibition of the same enzyme was shown to result in different metabolic consequences in the case of BCKDH where inhibition in RS4 cells caused a demonstrable increase in BCKDH substrates whereas in MCF-7 cells inhibition led to a decrease in the products of the enzymatic reaction. This difference may then lead to different consequences on cell growth as the substrates for BCKDH are known to be toxic metabolites and result in the an toxicity in the metabolic syndrome maple syrup urine disease. We have previously shown that RS4 cells as well as other lymphoid leukemia cell lines have a biphasic dose response to thiaminase where there is an initial growth inhibition related to extracellular thiamine depletion and a cytotoxic response at higher concentrations related to intracellular thiamine depletion 7 . Gabapentin appears to be protective against the growth inhibitory effects of thiaminase in RS4 cells at the concentrations that produce extracellular thiamine depletion indicating that growth inhibition is not due solely to thiamine depletion but also to the accumulation of branched-chain amino acid catabolites. These studies demonstrate that the cell lines and presumable tumors have different metabolic consequences resulting from inhibition of the same enzymes and that these consequences may form the basis of sensitivity to TDE inhibition as well as identify potential biomarkers of response. In addition thiaminase treatment was associated with increased lipolysis and decreased polyamine synthesis (data not shown) both of which were reversed by co-treatment with rapamycin. These changes are consistent with altered energy production and reduced cellular proliferation as a result of thiamine depletion but also may be related to our previous observation that mammary tumor formation is delayed in mice fed a low-thiamine normal-fat diet but not in mice fed a low-thiamine high-fat diet 4 . Although fatty acid metabolism may be affected by inhibition of 2-hydroxyl-CoA lyase (HACL1) a peroxisomal enzyme that also requires thiamine pyrophosphate as a cofactor and mediates the catabolism of branched chain fatty acids and 2-hydroxyl straight chain fatty acids 17 we did not see any evidence for accumulation of these metabolites in either cell line. Conclusions Overall these studies demonstrate that TDE disruption leads to specific metabolic consequences that are predictable from its role as a cofactor for enzymes that catalyze important steps in energy production biomass generation and amino acid catabolism. Comparison of the changes observed with thiaminase treatment in RS4 cells versus MCF-7 cells reveals different biochemical signatures as a result of thiamine depletion that may reflect differences in the relative contributions of different pathways to energy production and anaplerotic contributions to the TCA cycle. The near-global reversal of the specific metabolic effects of thiaminase by rapamycin indicate a closer regulation of thiamine-dependent metabolism by mTOR than has been previously appreciated and further studies are needed to determine how mTOR signaling pathways regulates thiamine-dependent metabolism. The disruption of thiamine metabolism results in cytotoxicity in breast cancer and leukemia tumor model systems and has the potential to provide novel targets for therapies directed toward these malignancies.

Exploring novel approaches to treatment of these subtypes is critical since less than 30 of women with metastatic breast cancer survive five years and virtually all women with metastatic TNBC will ultimately die of their disease despite systemic therapy. To date not a single targeted therapy has been approved for the treatment of TNBC and cytotoxic chemotherapy remains the standard treatment. We will discuss the current and upcoming therapeutic strategies being explored in an attempt to target TNBC.

Estimating and informing women of their risk is essential for tailoring appropriate screening and risk reduction strategies. Methods: Data were collected for BreastCARE a randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate a PC-tablet based intervention providing multiethnic women and their primary care physicians with tailored information about breast cancer risk. We included women ages 40 74 visiting general internal medicine primary care clinics at one academic practice and one safety net practice who spoke English Spanish or Cantonese and had no personal history of breast cancer. We collected baseline information regarding risk perception and concern. Women were categorized as high risk (vs. average risk) if their family history met criteria for referral to genetic counseling or if they were in the top 5 of risk for their age based on the Gail or Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium Model (BCSC) breast cancer risk model. Results: Of 1261 participants 25 (N 314) were classified as high risk. More average risk than high risk women had correct risk perception (72 vs. 18 ); 25 of both average and high risk women reported being very concerned about breast cancer. Average risk women with correct risk perception were less likely to be concerned about breast cancer (odds ratio OR 0.3; 95 confidence interval CI 0.2 0.4) while high risk women with correct risk perception were more likely to be concerned about breast cancer (OR 5.1; 95 CI 2.7 9.6). Conclusions: Many women did not accurately perceive their risk for breast cancer. Women with accurate risk perception had an appropriate level of concern about breast cancer. Improved methods of assessing and informing women of their breast cancer risk could motivate high risk women to apply appropriate prevention strategies and allay unnecessary concern among average risk women.

This study aimed to determine whether patients with prostate cancer have EN2 autoantibodies what the prevalence of these antibodies is and whether they are associated with disease stage. The spontaneous immunoglobulin (Ig)G immune response against EN2 and for comparison the tumour antigen New York Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma 1 (NY-ESO-1) were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in three different cohorts of prostate cancer patients as well as a group of men genetically predisposed to prostate cancer. Thirty-two of 353 (9 1 ) of the SUN cohort representing all stages of prostate cancer demonstrated EN2 IgG responses 12 of 107 patients (11 2 ) in the advanced prostate cancer patients showed responses while only four of 121 patients (3 3 ) with castrate-resistant prostate cancer showed EN2 autoantibodies. No significant responses were found in the predisposed group. Anti-EN2 IgG responses were significantly higher in patients with prostate cancer compared to healthy control males and similarly prevalent to anti-NY-ESO-1 responses. While EN2 autoantibodies are not a useful diagnostic or monitoring tool EN2 immunogenicity provides the rationale to pursue studies using EN2 as an immunotherapeutic target. autoantibodies Engrailed-2 prostate cancer BMC Cancer BMC Cancer BMC Cancer 1471-2407 BioMed Central 24383403 3880410 1471-2407-14-1 10.1186 1471-2407-14-1 Research Article Prolyl-4-hydroxylase ? subunit 2 promotes breast cancer progression and metastasis by regulating collagen deposition Xiong Gaofeng 1 gaofeng.xiong uky.edu Deng Lei 1 dnaxy hotmail.com Zhu Jieqing 1 jzh254 g.uky.edu Rychahou Piotr G 1 2 piotr.rychahou uky.edu Xu Ren 1 3 ren.xu2010 uky.edu 1Markey Cancer Center University of Kentucky Lexington KY 40536 USA 2Department of Surgery University of Kentucky Lexington KY 40536 USA 3Department of Molecular and Biomedical Pharmacology University of Kentucky 741 S.

Background Increased collagen deposition provides physical and biochemical signals to support tumor growth and invasion during breast cancer development. Therefore inhibition of collagen synthesis and deposition has been considered a strategy to suppress breast cancer progression. Collagen prolyl-4-hydroxylase ? subunit 2 (P4HA2) an enzyme hydroxylating proline residues in -X-Pro-Gly- sequences is a potential therapeutic target for the disorders associated with increased collagen deposition. However expression and function of P4HA2 in breast cancer progression are not well investigated. Methods Gene co-expression analysis was performed in the published microarray datasets to identify potential regulators of collagen I III and IV in human breast cancer tissue. Expression of P4HA2 was silenced by shRNAs and its activity was inhibited by 1 4-DPCA a prolyl-4-hydroxylase inhibitor. Three-dimensional culture assay was used to analyze roles of P4HA2 in regulating malignant phenotypes of breast cancer cells. Reduced deposition of collagen I and IV was detected by Western blotting and immunofluorescence. Control and P4HA2-silenced breast cancer cells were injected into fat pad and tail vein of SCID mice to examine effect of P4HA2 on tumor growth and lung metastasis. Results Using gene co-expression analysis we showed that P4HA2 was associated with expression of Col1A1 Col3A1 and Col4A1 during breast cancer development and progression. P4HA2 mRNA levels were significantly upregulated in breast cancer compared to normal mammary tissue. Increased mRNA levels of P4HA2 correlated with poor clinical outcome in breast cancer patients which is independent of estrogen receptor status. Silencing P4HA2 expression or treatment with the P4HA inhibitor significantly inhibited cell proliferation and suppressed aggressive phenotypes of breast cancer cells in 3D culture accompanied by reduced deposition of collagen I and IV. We also found that knockdown of P4HA2 inhibited mammary tumor growth and metastasis to lungs in xenograft models. Conclusion These results suggest the critical role of P4HA2 in breast cancer progression and identify P4HA2 as a potential therapeutic target and biomarker for breast cancer progression. Tumor microenvironment Breast cancer Collagen deposition Cancer progression Cell proliferation Background Extracellular matrix (ECM) is an important component of tumor microenvironment and plays critical roles in cancer development 1-3 . Collagens are the major structural ECM proteins and form fibers or networks in tumor tissue 4-6 . Cell-collagen interaction controls a variety of cellular activities including proliferation migration and invasion through integrin and discoidin domain receptor 7-9 . Enhanced expression and deposition of collagens are associated with tumor development and progression 10-12 . Recent studies demonstrate that increased collagen deposition and crosslinking enhance the stiffness and density of mammary tissue 51013 which is an important risk factor for breast cancer development. Type I collagen has been identified as a prognosis marker and is associated with cancer recurrence in human breast cancer patients 14 . Collagen VI knockout mice have reduced primary tumor formation and growth 12 while enhancing collagen deposition and inhibiting collagen degradation significantly enhances tumor initiation and tumor growth 510 . In addition cancer cell invasion usually occurs at tumor-stromal interfaces with oriented collagen fibers and aligned collagen fibers can facilitate cell migration and metastasis 5101115 . These results indicate that increased collagen expression and deposition promotes breast cancer development and progression by enhancing tumor growth and invasion. Therefore inhibiting collagen synthesis or deposition is a promising strategy to suppress breast cancer progression. Collagen biosynthesis is a multistep process that involves several post-transcription modification enzymes and one of the most important members of these enzymes is collagen prolyl-4-hydroxylase 16 . It catalyzes the formation of 4-hydroxyproline by hydroxylating proline residues in -X-Pro-Gly- sequences 17-20 . Collagen prolyl-4-hydroxylase resides within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 18 and its expression is used as a marker for collagen synthesis 2122 . Because 4-hydroxyproline residues formed in this reaction are essential for triple helix formation and stabilization of collagen 22-24 inhibiting the prolyl-4-hydroxylases activity efficiently blocks collagen synthesis and deposition. All known vertebrate collagen prolyl-4-hydroxylases are ?2?2 tetramers consisting of two ? subunits and two ? subunits. Each ? subunit contains the peptide substrate binding domain and the two catalytic sites of the enzyme and the ? subunits have been identified as protein disulfide isomerases 171925 . Three types of collagen prolyl-4-hydroxylases ? isoforms (P4HA1 P4HA2 and P4HA3) have been identified in human tissue. P4HA1 is expressed in most cell types; P4HA2 is mainly expressed in chondrocytes osteoblasts and capillary endothelial cells; P4HA3 expression is detected in adult and fetal tissues at very low levels compared to P4HA1 and P4HA2 1826 . Increased P4HA2 expression has been detected in many solid tumors including oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma papillary thyroid cancer and breast cancer 27-30 however the function of P4HA2 in cancer progression largely remains to be determined. Here we showed that expression of P4HA2 and collagen genes (Col1A1 Col3A1 and Col4A1) is significantly correlated during breast cancer development and progression and that increased mRNA levels of P4HA2 are associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. Silencing P4HA2 or treatment with the P4HA inhibitor attenuates cell proliferation and suppresses aggressive 3D phenotypes tumor growth and cancer metastasis\nLabels: [Thyroid_Cancer, Colon_Cancer, Lung_Cancer]\nReply with one label only.", "assistant": "Lung_Cancer"}

{"system": "You are a medical text classifier. Choose exactly one label.", "user": "Text: In addition how differential TS genotypes may impact on the outcome of patients depending on their smoking status or with Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) activating mutations tumors is to be determined. Finally although the toxicity profile described in most patients receiving pemetrexed in combination or as a single agent is usually favorable there are several reported cases of fundamentally dermatological hematological and potentially serious renal toxicities even when the recommended vitamin prophylaxis guidelines have been followed 13-15 . Nonetheless the tumor TS levels or its polymorphisms in each patient could explain these cases of severe toxicity as it has been suggested in other neoplasms treated with other antifolate drugs 9 . The potential association between different TS genotypes and the toxicity experienced by a European population of patients with NSCLC receiving pemetrexed is also to be studied. Three different types of polymorphisms have been described in the TS gene. In the gene promoter there is a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) of 28 pb in the 5?- region. Thus cases of two or three repetitions of this tandem TS gene promoter enhancer region (TSER) have been described 16 . A second type of polymorphism consists in a change in a single nucleotide (G ?C) in one of the sequences of the repetition comprising a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 16 . A third modality of polymorphisms consists in the deletion or insertion of 6 pair of bases (bp) in the 3?-UTR region (untranslated region) 16 . In summary the potential usefulness of TS genotype as an independent prognostic factor or predictor of response to pemetrexed-based regimens in a European NSCLC population has not been studied. Similarly no clear evidence is available about the potential correlation between the different TS genotypes and the toxicity experienced by those patients. Therefore we decided to investigate the three known polymorphisms of TS gene and their correlation with objective response rate (ORR) progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) as well as toxicity in European patients with advanced NSCLC treated with pemetrexed-based regimens. Methods Patients and samples Overall 25 consecutive stage III-IV NSCLC patients treated at a single institution from which peripheral blood samples were available were analyzed. All of them received pemetrexed-based regimens in the first second or third line settings according to our institutional therapeutic protocols. After the informed consent was obtained from all patients 10 ml of peripheral blood samples were collected before the administration of the first cycle of a pemetrexed-containing regimen. Blood samples were stored at the Biobank of the University of Navarra and were processed following standard operating procedures approved by the Ethical and Scientific Committees. Tumor ORR to the treatment was assessed using computerized tomography (CT) scans every two pemetrexed-based chemotherapy cycles and categorized according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 as per institutional protocol. The toxicities recorded during pemetrexed-based treatment were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. TS enhancer region genotyping analysis The genomic DNA was extracted from the peripheral leucocytes. The genotypes of the TSER (VNTR) and SNP were determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) of 28 bp polymorphism and the G???C SNP in the first and second repeat were analyzed. A DNA fragment was amplified using previously described PCR conditions and primers 17 and directly sequenced using an ABI PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems Foster City CA USA). The forward primer 5?-CGTGGCTCCTGCGTTTCC-3? and the reverse primer 3?-GAGCCGGCCACAGGCAT-5? were used. A modification of conventional conditions was necessary. PCR was performed in a reaction mixture with dNTP: 0.35 ?l Buffer: 0.25 ?l MgCl2: 17.5 ?l Tap polymerase: 0.5 ?l H2O: 18 ?l primers 0.1? ?0.1 ?l DMSO: 1.25 ?l and DNA: 2 ?l. The cycling conditions were denaturation 95 C for 10 minutes and 30 cycles at 95 C for one minute then at 64 C for one minute and 72 C one minute and finally seven minutes at 72?ºC. Aliquots of amplified fragments were separated on a 3 agarose gel and the TS VNTR genotype was determined staining 2R (210 base pairs; bp) and 3R (238 bp) alleles. After that we performed a PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) by Hae III digestion. The mixture was PCR product: 10 ?l H2O: 7 ?l Buffer 2 ?l and Hae III: 1 ?l. After that we incubated the mixture at 37 C overnight. Aliquots of digested fragments were separated on 12 acrylamide gel and the SNP genotype was determined. The digestion of fragments showed the different genotypes 2RGC: 664746 44 and 7 bp 2RCC: 11346 44 and 7 bp 3RGGCC (3RG): 66474644 28 and 7 bp 3RGCC (3RC): 944746 44 and 7 bp. TS 3?UTR region genotyping analysis The 3?UTR polymorphisms were analyzed by Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP). A fragment containing the 6 bp deletion insertion was amplified using the reverse primer 5?-CAGATAAGTGGCAGTACAGA-3?and the forward primer 3?-CAAATCTGAGGGAGCTGAGT-5? in 10 ul of reaction mixture with dNTP: 4 ?l Buffer: 5 ?l MgCl2: 4 ?l Tap polymerase: 0.5 ?l H2O: 26.5 ?l primers 4? ?4 ?l and DNA: 2 ?l. The cycling conditions were denaturation 95 C for 10 minutes and 35 cycles at 95 C for 30 minutes then at 57 C for 30 minutes and 72 C one minute and finally seven minutes at 72 C. The fragments were amplified on 2 agarose gel. Afterwards the products were digested with Dra I and the mixture of PCR product: 20 ?l BSA 10 : 0.5 ?l Buffer: 5 ?l H2O: 23.5 ?l and Dra I: 1 ?l. Posteriorly the product was incubated one hour at 37 C. The final digested product was separated in a 3 agarose gel. The different genotypes were deletion 6 bp insertion 6 bp insertion 6 bp insertion 6 bp and deletion 6 bp deletion 6 bp. The expected fragment sizes by genotyping were deletion 6 bp insertion 6 bp: 148142 88 and 60 bp insertion 6 bp insertion 6 bp: 88 and 60 bp and deletion 6 bp deletion 6 bp: 142 bp. We repeated the PCR three times to ensure final results. EGFR mutations analysis As per institutional protocol all patients with advanced NSCLC were tested for EGFR activating mutations before treatment initiation. In brief after having the samples fixed in alcohol and stained by Papanicolau stain DNA was extracted and amplified by PCR technique using EGFR gene exons 1819 20 and 21 specific primers. ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer equipment was used for the analysis of the sequencing reactions with both forward and reverse primers. Statistical analysis Fisher s exact test was used to investigate the correlation between each genotype and the response to the treatment and the toxicity presented. Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank test or Tarone-Ware test when indicated were calculated to correlate each genotype with the survival outcomes (PFS and OS). For the subgroup analysis EGFR mutation status and smoking history were considered in order to analyze potential differences in clinical outcome measures (ORR PFS and OS). The SPSS 15.0 software (SPSS Inc. Chicago IL) was employed to perform the statistical analysis. Results Patients characteristics and treatment The clinical and pathological characteristics of the patients included are summarized in . In brief our cohort was mainly composed by males with a median age of 59 years and a past smoking history showing good performance status. Most of the patients showed adenocarcinoma histology (88 ) and showed distant metastasis (M1) at onset (72 ). Most of the patients received a pemetrexed-based regimen in first line (84 ). After a median follow up of 21 months 80 of patients have already progressed and 52 of them have died due to disease progression ().

Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR). In addition in 8 out of the 18 subjects showing multiple brain metastases at onset conventional whole-brain radiotherapy (300 cGy) was administered between first and second chemotherapy cycles following our institutional treatment guidelines. Finally 4 out of the 7 patients showing no distant metastases at onset responded to the pemetrexed-based induction chemotherapy. As per institutional protocol all four subjects underwent a 3-D conformal radiotherapy program with concurrent chemotherapy as previously published 18 . Correlation between ORR to the treatment and polymorphisms We studied the potential correlation between the different polymorphisms observed and the response to the treatment obtained (Table 2). For this purpose any kind of radiological response (complete or partial response) was compared to no response to the treatment (disease stabilization or progression). The presence of 3R 3R polymorphism seemed to predict a higher ORR (100 ) compared to the rest of the genotypes with a trend toward statistical significance (p ?0.055). In the subgroup analysis a significantly higher ORR to pemetrexed for wild-type EGFR patients showing a 3R 3R genotype (100 ) compared to the 2R 2R (77.8 ) 2R 3R (33.3 ) and 3R 4R (0 ) was observed (p ?0.017).

Overall a non-significant correlation between the different 3?-UTR polymorphisms and the ORR was observed. However the genotype 6 6 seemed to predict a higher ORR among active former smokers (A FS) compared to 6 -6 (100 vs. 50 ; p ?0.085). Correlation between PFS and polymorphisms Regarding TSER polymorphisms we found a trend toward statistical significance (p ?0.089) in the differences in PFS observed among the different genotypes in favor of the 3R 3R genotype (Figure 1A). Figure 1 Kaplan-Meier curves for progression-free survival (PFS) in months (mo) associated with the different TS polymorphisms. A: TSER genotypes. B: Presence or absence of SNP. C: 3 UTR genotypes. In the case of the absence or presence of a SNP at the third repetition (3R allele) we observed a non-significant increased PFS in the subgroup of patients showing an absence of SNP (Figure 1B). Finally no significant correlations regarding the 3?UTR genotypes and PFS were observed (Figure 1C). Correlation between OS and polymorphisms In this cohort we found a significant correlation between TSER polymorphisms and OS (Figure 2A). The median OS was not reached for 3R 3R genotype patients whereas 2R 3R genotype subjects showed a 70 m OS followed by 3R 4R and 2R 2R genotypes with a median OS of 15 m and 13 m respectively (p ?0.019) (Figure 2A). Figure 2 Kaplan-Meier curves for overall survival (OS) in months (mo) associated with the different TS polymorphisms. A: TSER genotypes. B: Presence or absence of SNP. C: 3 UTR genotypes. No significant differences in OS were observed with regards to the presence absence of SNP (Figure 2B) or regarding the 3?-UTR polymorphisms (Figure 2C). Correlation between toxicity and polymorphisms The most frequent toxicity was grade (G)1 anemia (28 ) and nausea (20 ) and G2 leucopenia (40 ). The most commom G3-4 toxicities were leucopenia (16 ) asthenia (8 ) anemia (4 ) neutropenia (4 ) and dyspnea (4 ). Overall we found no significant correlations between the toxicity profiles experienced by the patients and the different TS genotypes (Table 3).

TS is the main biological target of pemetrexed. Some studies have suggested that TS expression could be a predictive factor of response in NSCLC 19 . Moreover some VNTR genotypes have been associated with TS expression and activity in other tumor types such as colorectal cancer 17 . In NSCLC patients a correlation between different genotypes and the TS protein expression has been shown 20 . Shintani et al. 20 also confirmed that the TS mRNA levels were significantly higher in lung cancer tissues with the 3R 3R genotype as compared to those with the 2R 2R genotype. Nonetheless definitive studies addressing the correlation of the different genotypes of TS in circulating genomic DNA with response to the treatment PFS or OS in pemetrexed-treated NSCLC European patients are lacking. The potential influence of the EGFR status on those polymorphisms and their correlation with clinical outcome after pemetrexed-based treatment is also unexplored. A recent study by Hu et al. 21 investigated the different TS polymorphisms in genomic DNA of 90 Asian NSCLC patients. In contrast with our findings no specific genotype regarding the TSER or 3?-UTR polymorphisms studied seemed to correlate with a significant difference in ORR PFS or OS. This could be explained by substantial clinical differences between both populations. Our cohort was constituted by Caucasian patients compared to the Asian population studied by Hu et al. In addition our patients were mostly current or former smokers (72 ) compared to the Asian population that showed 62 of never smokers. Also in our cohort the subjects mainly received pemetrexed-based chemotherapy as a first line regimen (92 ) whereas the cohort studied by Hu et al. 21 was treated with pemetrexed as a second or further line in 62.2 of the cases. These remarkable differences in basic clinical characteristics and in particular the ethnicity between both cohorts are probably also explaining the differences observed in the 3?-UTR genotype frequency between our population and the one studied by Hu et al. In our cohort 6 bp 6 bp 6 bp -6 bp and -6 bp -6 bp genotypes were found in 48 44 and 8 of the cases respectively. In contrast0.078 47.8 and 44.4 were respectively found in the population studied by Hu et al. 21 . In a previous analysis performed on another Caucasian NSCLC population evaluated at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center 22 a similar proportion of 3?-UTR genotypes according to our findings was observed (49.2 of 6 bp 6 bp 42.4 of 6 bp -6 bp and 8.4 of -6 bp -6 bp). Additionally the low prevalence of the 6 bp 6 bp genotype in an Asian population compared to our cohort may be confirmed by a recent study in which from 106 Asian NSCLC patients investigated none of them showed a 6 bp 6 bp genotype in genomic circulating DNA 23 . Nontheless in this latter study 23 a significantly higher ORR was observed among patients showing a -6 bp -6 bp 3?-UTR genotype compared to the ORR reported for patients presenting a -6 bp 6 bp polymorphism (32.2 vs 12.7 ; p ?0.008). Accordingly in our cohort a higher ORR in patients showing a -6 bp -6 bp genotype compared to those presenting a -6 bp 6 bp polymorphism was also observed (100 vs. 54.5 ). However the statistical significance was not reached probably due to the relatively low number of patients included in our analysis. Interestingly enough in the subgroup analysis of our data the 6 bp 6 bp genotype seemed to predict a higher ORR only among active former smokers compared to 6 bp -6 bp (100 vs. 50 ; p ?0.085). This novel observation if validated in future studies could be relevant for selecting specific drugs for each patient in a second or third line setting. With regards to the TSER polymorphisms the presence of a 3R 3R polymorphism seemed to predict a higher ORR with a clear trend toward statistical significance (p ?0.055). Moreover that difference was even greater and statistically significant benefiting the subpopulation of wild-type EGFR patients. To our knowledge this is the first time that such observation has been made. An interesting preclinical study by Giovannetti et al. 24 investigated the activity profile of a combination therapy against NSCLC cell lines with different genotypes with erlotinib and pemetrexed. Remarkably pemetrexed increased EGFR phosphorylation and reduced Akt phosphorylation. Additionally erlotinib significantly reduced TS expression and activity. Thus when erlotinib and pemetrexed were combined a strong synergism in all NSCLC cells regardless of their genetic signature was observed. This potential crosstalk between the EGFR signaling pathway and the TS expression and activity could in part explain our novel findings showing a significantly higher ORR to pemetrexed in those wild-type EGFR patients harboring a 3R 3R polymorphism. However none of the previous studies have described the EGFR status of the patients analyzed and how that status impacted on the ORR to pemetrexed for certain TS polymorphisms. In terms of survival in the present series after a median follow-up of 21 months PFS was superior for those patients showing a 3R 3R genotype with a trend toward statistical significance as expected considering the higher ORR observed for patients with the same TSER genotype. The relatively low statistical power of our clinical cohort may be accounting for the lack of a full statistical significance observed. Regarding OS the advantage in PFS observed in patients showing the 3R 3R genotype translated into a significantly higher median OS in patients with the same polymorphism compared to the rest. Conversely in the study by Hu et al. 21 no specific genotype was significantly correlated with a superior PFS or OS. As aforementioned the dramatic differences in the population s characteristics between both series might possibly explain this discordance. In our study conversely to the observations made by Wang et al. 23 a significantly superior PFS and OS in patients with the -6 bp -6 bp 3?-UTR genotype has not been confirmed. Most probably this is also due to the differences in the genotype distribution among populations with markedly different ethnicity and epidemiological characteristics. Finally in accordance with Wang et al. 23 the toxicity profile was not significantly correlated with any TS genotype in our series. As aforementioned this study has some limitations due to its retrospective nature and the low number of patients investigated. Both could be responsible for a low statistical power that may impair our ability to find significant differences between subgroups of patients. Conclusions For the first time in a European population of NSCLC patients receiving pemetrexed the presence of the TSER 3R 3R polymorphism significantly correlated with a superior OS. Moreover this same polymorphism when associated to wild-type EGFR was correlated with a higher ORR to pemetrexed. The presence of the 6 -6 bp 3?-UTR genotype among active or former smokers was correlated to a higher ORR showing a trend toward statistical significance. Finally pemetrexed-induced toxicity was not significantly correlated with a specific TS genotype. These novel data warrant further investigation in larger prospective series and may help to patient s selection if finally validated.

The genes are enriched in 32 REACTOME pathways (False Discovery Rate (FDR) 0.05 pathway size 96). We assumed the 32 pathways were valid as ground truth to be identified and analyzed in the colon cancer dataset GSE39585 (Stages II and III were only considered). Average Z provided best performer (sensitivity 0.88) with 28 pathways deemed as significant. GSEA Fisher Euclidean and Mahalanobis gave the following values0.780.66 0.06 and 0.03 respectively.These results satisfied us that our approach captures the fundamental knowledge of cancer thus it is reasonably considered as iPAS.To investigate which of the candidates for iPAS most robustly reflect phenotype association we evaluated the proposed methods by determining whether survival-associated pathways are validated in datasets never used for discovery using LUAD and colon cancer LUAD: Beer s set n 442 for discovery GSE8894 (n 61) GSE3141 (n 58) for validation; colon cancer: GSE39582d (n 443) for discovery GSE39582v (n 123) and GSE17536 (n 109) for validation logrank P 0.05 comparing tumors in the top 50th percentile of aberrance scores to those in the bottom 50th percentile . Validation rates varied depending on the dataset and these were possibly affected by the small sample size compared with that of the discovery set. In these cases we were not able to determine a superior method that outperformed the others. Average Z gave the highest validation rate in three of four dataset with validation rates of GSE8894 (43.6 92 211) GSE3141 (13.3 28 211) and GSE17536 (10.7 24 224). When validation rates from four datasets are averaged Average Z gave the highest validation rate (21.9 Fig. 2 blue bars). Pathways validated as significantly associated with patient survival for each cancer are listed in the Supplementary Materials (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). Fig. 2.Averaged validation rate of discovered survival-related pathway at four datasets. Proposed approach using nRef (blue) versus conventional approach that standardizes individual sample by mean and SD of entire cohort dataset (red)We also investigated the validation rate of iPAS candidates under the conditions where the same data are not standardized by the nRef but instead standardized by the mean and SD of the cohort dataset which consists of only cancers (Fig. 2 red bars). It is noteworthy that use of the nRef increased the validation rate for every iPAS candidate investigated. This implies that the strategy of using accumulated normal samples as a reference is beneficial in terms of pathway-based survival analysis.3.2 Identification of clinical importanceCluster analysis of using Average Z as the iPAS method on Beer s data identified 12 pathway clusters (denoted by 1?12 in Fig. 3) and 3 sample clusters (S2?S4; S1 is from the nRef; Fig. 3). Sample clusters S2 and S4 represent well the differentiation status of LUAD (Fisher exact test P 4.65 10?15). Well-differentiated adenocarcinoma resembles the normal glandular structure; therefore it is a reasonable result that cluster S2 is close to the nRef. The survival outcome of S2 and S4 are significantly different (P 0.0028) and this assures us that unbiased clustering-based iPAS has enough sensitivity to capture clinically important associations. This finding is concordant with prior knowledge that well-differentiated LUAD patients are likely to have better prognosis (Barletta et al. 2010). Pathway cluster P9 is distinguished as commonly upregulated in tumor samples. The pathways are transfer RNA aminoacylation amino acid or purine synthesis DNA elongation and the extension of telomeres. Fig. 3.Clustered iPAS of LUAD dataset. Pathways (n 583) and samples (n 442) are clustered according to iPAS. Normal samples are clustered at left (S1). Tumors (S2?S4) deviate from normal in both up- and downregulated directions (darker red and blue respectively). Sample clusters are well-representing histopathological differentiation status (S2: for well-differentiated LUAD P 4.65 10?15) and overall survivalUnbiased pathway-based clustering of colon cancer data also captures clinically important associations by revealing sample clusters that are survival related (S2 and S3 P 0.0037 Supplementary Fig. S1). It is important to note that iPAS is not only sensitive enough to identify clinically meaningful substructure of patients but also reveals common characteristics of a cancer at the same time. For example pathways commonly up- or downregulated in all cancer samples for example P9 or P2 would have not been discovered if the analysis had been performed by a conventional approach that does not make use of nRef (Supplementary Fig. S2).3.3 Pathway-based identification of cancerCancer develops unique mechanisms for malignancy. Therefore it is reasonable to believe that identifying the unique molecular aberrances of cancer will aid in cancer diagnosis. Our empirical study of iPAS-based clustering of LUAD revealed several pathways commonly up- or downregulated in all of the cancer samples. Further analysis was performed to determine whether iPAS could be successfully used in the accurate identification of cancer. We tested this in a simple unsupervised way by judging whether an unknown sample is significantly different against the nRef as a tumor if not as normal. We performed a 5-fold cross-validation one hundred times with the LUAD dataset which consisted of 120 cancers and 120 normal samples. Microarray data from the normal samples was randomly divided into five groups and four of the five served as the reference group. The remaining group was used as the true normal set for the test of pathway-based identification of cancer. To build true cancer set for the test the same number of cancer sample was randomly picked. We considered 583 pathways in REACTOME giving 293 500 (583 pathways 5-fold 100 repeats) AUCs and accuracy values. We averaged AUCs and accuracies from the five candidate methods for iPAS and used this as a representative AUC and accuracy of a given pathway.By ranking the pathways by AUC top pathways that marked averagely high performance by all iPAS candidates are listed (Supplementary Table S3). The amino acid synthesis and interconversion and transamination pathway showed the highest classification performance. Unsurprisingly this pathway was one of the commonly upregulated pathways in the analysis of the Beer s data (Fig. 3 pathway cluster P9). Among the tested iPAS candidates for this pathway Mahalanobis yielded the highest AUC (0.980) while Average Z gave 0.936 and Fisher s exact test gave the lowest value (0.914). The standardized gene expression pattern for this pathway differed between tumor and normal. Many of the genes deviated from mean of the nRef by more than two orders of sigma contributing to its best performance out of all iPAS candidate methods including ORA method like Fisher s exact test (Fig. 4a). Fig. 4.(a) Expression pattern of genes in the pathway. Each line represents sample. (gray: normal red: tumor). Dashed line represents expression value deviated 1.96? from the mean expression value of normal tissues. (b). Performance of classification of cancer by amino acid synthesis and interconversion and transamination . AUC of 0.980 has marked in discovery set (95 confidence interval provided as error bar) independent validation set results AUC of 0.982 (Validation 1: normal samples in validation set served as reference) and 0.982 (Validation 2: normal samples in discovery set served as reference)We also analyzed the influence of using the subset of normal samples as nRef. We compared the pathway-based cancer identification results using the full set of normal samples (n 120) against 100 different runs using 75 (n 90) 50 (n 60) of randomly chosen normal samples. Among the pathways that marked averagely high performance in the identification of cancer the best and the second best pathways are considered amino acid synthesis and interconversion and transamination and unwind of DNA respectively. The result shows little loss of performance even though only a half of normal samples were used for the test (Fig. 5a and b).

nucleotide genome serves as an mrna template for the translation of viral proteins4 the virion contains four proteins spike envelope membrane and nucleocapsid and the host receptor with which the spike surface glycoprotein of sarscov2 engages is angiotensin converting enzyme ace25 the biology of sarscov2 is described in more detail in figure a zinc metallopeptidase enzyme ace2 which is

severe pneumonia with sequelae that include acute respiratory distress syndrome ards cytokine storm and death10 because sars is an acronym for severe acute respiratory syndrome digestive manifestations including inappetence nausea abdominal pain and diarrhea of covid19 resulting from binding of the virus to the ace2 receptor in the gi tract may precede respiratory symptoms11 gastrointestinal manifestations are potentially underappreciated and overlooked as sentinel symptoms that herald the onset or persistence of disease especially in cancer patients and may contribute to delayed or missed opportunities for testing diagnosis and containment unlike sarscov1 which seems to have disappeareddied out12 and mers which reappears only sporadically sarscov2 is less lethal with

mobilization efforts to mitigate its spread old age smoking and comorbidities such as diabetes morbid obesity immunosuppression frailty and cardiovascular disease appear to predispose to worse outcomes possibly secondary to impaired t and b cell responses notably covid19 infection is associated with lymphopenia and delayed development of the adaptive immune response which appears to correlate with prolonged virus clearance and more severe disease progression15 the first pillar of defense against infection is hand washing avoidance of face touching and minimization of close contact ie social distancing with selfquarantine and selfisolation16 in case of exposure or evidence of covid19 symptoms respectively the second prophylactic pillar is vaccination with specific viral antigens or mrnas which are not yet publicly available although the company moderna has reportedly started testing an mrna vaccine in healthy volunteers and multiple other vaccination

inhalation from sneezing coughing or exhalation 22and via fomitetoface contact since depending on the surface material the virus may remain viable and infectious for hours to days figure fecaloral transmission has also been hypothesized because diarrhea was a common feature with sars and mers and diarrhea and other digestive issues have also been reported in patients with covid1925 26notably transmission of sarscov2 is not limited to symptomatic individuals ie those with fever cough sore throat myalgias or dyspnea but also to asymptomatic or subclinically infected carriers of the virus which is problematic from the perspective of disease control 27and highlights the importance of containment measures including isolation and quarantine the basic reproduction number r0 of sarscov2 is which means that on average for every patient an additional individuals are infected because coronaviruses may persist on inanimate surfaces like metal glass or plastic for up to days careful

clinical courses and outcomes of covid19 are likely to be worse in patients with cancer especially given the clear association between severity of disease and older age and higher levels of comorbidity the overall case fatality rate cfr for the general covid19infected population is around but in cancer it rises to overall and to in italy19 this cfr in cancer patients compares to for no comorbid conditions for cardiovascular disease for diabetes for hypertension and for chronic respiratory disease the aim of this review is to summarize and condense the current understanding of the transmission clinical presentation diagnosis and differential diagnosis pathogenesis treatment and prevention of covid19 with a special focus on cancer in the united states the test of choice for sarscov2 is a nasopharyngeal swab specimen or sputum if a productive cough is present on which a reversetranscriptase pcr rtpcr assay or an enzymelinked immunoassay eia directed particularly at the envelope e rnadependent rna polymerase rdrp spike protein s and nucleocapsid n genes is performed the fda has also approved an antibody test29 a positive test for sarscov2 in a symptomatic patient generally confirms the diagnosis of covid19 with the caveat that false positive and false negative tests have been documented if initial testing is negative but a high index of suspicion and pretest probability for covid19 remains on the basis of patient signs and symptoms then retesting is indicated in patients with high indexes of clinical suspicion and equivocal or negative test results the who recommends that lower respiratory tract specimens which contain the highest viral loads should be obtained since nasopharyngeal swabs may miss some infections30 according to cdc guidelines disease is excluded on the basis of two 0c preproofconsecutive negative tests respiratory tests separated by hours however in the presence of suggestive symptoms rectal swabs may also be indicated since the ace2 enzyme to which the virus binds is abundantly present in rectal epithelia cells31 the differential diagnosis for sarscov2 in cancer is extremely broad and includes conditions such as foreign body

bordetella pertussis legionella pneumophila and mycoplasma pneumoniae32 the diagnosis of sarscov2 is complicated by the possibility of simultaneous coinfection with other respiratory viruses33 which is especially true for immunosuppressed cancer patients whose susceptibility to microanisms is increased the heightened infectious risk for cancer patients underscores the importance of screening them at presentation with extended viral respiratory panel testing given that coinfection may impact management decisions since conceptually at least the morbidity of covid19 and the risk of severe illness should increase in the presence of a second or third virus preproofunlike infection with influenza for example covid19 signs and symptoms may vary considerably depending on the dose of viral inoculum route of inoculation concomitant medications and underlying health status34 to include fever dry cough fatigue sputum production shortness of breath sore throat headache myalgia or arthralgia chills nausea or vomiting nasal congestion diarrhea hemoptysis and conjunctival congestion with an incubation period of to days after exposure36 presymptomatic or minimally symptomatic infection may majorly drive transmission especially since detected viral loads are similar in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients3738 populations of concern include the elderly smokers vapers and dual users those of any age with preexisting chronic medical conditions those receiving particular medications or therapies which upregulate the ace2 receptor or suppress the immune system and those from lower socioeconomic classes a conglomeration of factors which are often present in cancer patients as depicted in figure while the surveillance focus for covid19 is on the respiratory tract enteric symptoms are a potentially underappreciated overlooked and misattributed manifestation of disease as stated earlier and this is especially the case for cancer patients where gastrointestinal toxicity occurs routinely from chemotherapy ie cisplatincarboplatinoxaliplatin irinotecan 5fluorouracil ifosfamide from targeted agents ie erlotinib imatinib bortezomib temsirolimus sunitinib regorafenibsorafenib and bevacizumab39 and from locally advanced or metastatic disease therefore abdominal complaints in cancer patients which are potentially but not automatically attributable to underlying disease justify further investigation especially if persistent worsening or new particularly because sarscov2 transmission may occur via the fecal oral route40 0c preproofabnormal laboratory findings in covid19 include lymphopenia percent prolonged prothrombin time percent elevated lactate dehydrogenase percent elevated ast and alt percent elevated highly sensitive hs crp and elevated procalcitonin however because these parameters routinely fall well outside of the normal reference range in cancer patients it is difficult to confirm or refute the presence of disease on this basis alone chest radiographs and chest ct abnormalities are similarly nonspecific since the most common features multifocal groundglass opacities and consolidation mimic other pneumonias41 significant antibody production is observed after infection but it is unknown whether this helps or harms since antibodydependent enhancement ade may potentiate viral entry and the induction of a severe inflammatory response42 universal screening of cancer patients for covid19 is desirable but logistically impossible for the foreseeable future since diagnostic tests are in short supply and simply not always readily available43 hence covid19 rule out criteria are proposed in table as a potential decisionmaking aide mÃ moire which separates patients into low and highrisk groups by analogy to the wells criteria for pulmonary embolism4445 preventive measures focus on selfisolation social distancing with a 6foot 2m separation46 frequent hand washing with soap and water andor use of hand sanitizers patient isolation during clinical care use of masks to help prevent aerosol transmission and flushing with the lid closed to control socalled toilet plume in an asco guidance immunocompromised cancer patients are advised to minimize exposure to sick contacts and large crowds48 for healthcare personnel the use of personal protective equipment such as n95 masks ffp3 masks gowns eye protection gloves and gowns is mandated49 preproof vaccination and immunity vaccination efforts and the related topic of whether those who have recovered from covid19 develop protective immunity have drawn great attention the latter has implications on whether people who test positive for sarscov2 antibodies can be safely assumed to be immune and at negligible risk of contracting or transmitting the disease there have been case reports of patients who have recovered from covid19 and had recurrence of rtpcr positivity approximately one month after initial diagnosis with only one patient exhibiting significant clinical symptoms and another having a mild intermittent cough50 but while not zero the risk of transmissibility or recurrence of symptomatic disease in recovered patients has yet to be quantified and the paucity of currently available reports of recurrence in the setting of a pandemic suggests that it is low a separate practical question will be whether antibodybased tests prove to have sufficient sensitivity and specificity to identify people who had asymptomatic infections developed immunity and can return to normal activities without jeopardizing disease containment efforts immunity may be due to antibodies cell mediated immunity or a combination of the two previous experience with using plasma from convalescent patients to treat severe cases of the first sars and mers as well as limited experience with covid19 suggests that antibody mediated immunity alone is clinically beneficial even during acute infection51 safety concerns about antibodies have been raised based on preclinical studies of sarscov vaccination in 0c preproofferrets showing hepatotoxicity52 and of vaccination against feline infectious peritonitis virus another coronavirus leading to more severe disease when kittens were subsequently challenged with the virus53 although animal models may not be representative of human hostpathogen interactions the nature of sarscov and sarscov2 antibodies are likely different as crossneutralization was not observed invitro54 and experience with convalescent plasma has not borne evidence of antibody mediated enhancement of infection in acutely infected patients the potential risk deserves attention if vaccination is proposed for the entire population t cell responses are also readily observable in patients who recover from coronavirus infections55 and memory t cell responses alone were protective in mice56 with the potential advantage of longer persistence of memory t cell responses compared to humoral immunity when clinical data on vaccine candidates becomes available cancer patients may face different considerations surrounding vaccination than the general population particularly patients with hematologic malignancies being treated with agents targeting b cells who would derive greater benefit from vaccines eliciting cell mediated than antibody responses preproofpathogenesis and pathology relating to ace2 and ras signaling the ace2 enzyme a key regulator of the reninangiotensin system ras57 to which the virus binds through its surface spike proteins is particularly abundant in the digestive tract lungs kidney heart and blood vessels where pathology from sarscov2 occurs58 a peptidase that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin ii angii referred to as the quintessential perpetrator of inflammation to angiotensin ang ace2 mediates antiproliferative and vasodilatory functions that oppose the vasoconstrictive and inflammatory functions of angiotensin converting enzyme ace60 the binding of sarscov2 to ace2 leads to downregulation of ace2 expression potentially through increased internalization and shedding from the cell surface with decreased ang1 generation and increased ang ii levels as a consequence61 this unfavorably shifts the balance of the renin angiotensin system ras from the vasoprotective ace2ang17 axis to the aceang iiangiotensin at1 receptor axis and drives a proinflammatory profibrotic and proliferative response62 as shown in figure fang et al63 contend that because thiazolidinediones ibuprofen and angiotensin converting enzyme ace inhibitors and angiotensin ii typei receptor blockers arbs substantially increase the expression of ace2 they facilitate sarscov2 infection and therefore the risk of severe and fatal covid19 in contrast alghatrif et al64 present a diametrically opposed hypothesis that downregulated ace2 signaling is responsible for sarscov2induced acute lung injury ali acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and cytokine storm and that aceis and arbs are beneficial precisely because they increase ace2 expression and activity furthermore according to alghatrif et al lower ace2 levels and hence higher baseline oxidative stress and inflammation6566 are present in older comorbid individuals such as cancer patients which renders them more susceptible to severe covid19 than younger noncomorbid individuals with increased ace2 levels and lower baseline inflammation as shown in figure furthermore low ace2 may promote tumor progression and conversely ace2 overexpression is associated with antiangiogenesis and tumor regression67 in summary then 0c preproofdespite the concerns and controversy68 surrounding the use and continuation of aceisarbs during the sarscov2 epidemic it is likely that the pros outweigh the cons especially in cancer patients due to their potential antitumor and anticovid19 effects69 in line with ras involvement emerging data suggest that sarscov2 infection may induce serious cardiovascular injury or exacerbate existing cardiovascular disease cardiovascular sequela includes heart failure arrythmias disseminated intravascular dissemination dic and troponin elevation which may closely correlate with disease severity and the likelihood of inhospital death70 liu et al71 propose a mechanism whereby the virus which lowers hemoglobin hb levels72 binds to the porphyrin of heme and displaces iron thereby compromising the oxygencarrying capacity of red blood cells and exacerbating the hypoxemia since chloroquine and the experimental anticancer agent rrx001 also bind to porphyrins they may competitively interfere with binding by the virus rationale for continuation or discontinuation of cancer therapy preproofthe benefitrisk calculus that informs the decision whether and how to treat with anticancer therapy falls into a gray zone about which no consensus exists leading to a therapeutic dilemma on the one hand zhang et al73 in annals of oncology reported a strong association in patients of them with lung cancer between antineoplastic therapy in the past days and severe effects of covid19 hr4079 ci p0037 on this basis the authors recommend treatment interruption dose reduction or substitution of cytotoxic chemotherapy with nonimmunosuppressive options eg checkpoint inhibitors if available especially in the case of lung cancer patients that are already prone to develop respiratory infections and complications74 similarly heavily immunosuppressed patients such as those who have undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplantation are also particularly susceptible to viral respiratory infections these findings are supported by a nationwide analysis of data75 in china from covid19 patients of which were diagnosed with cancer this patient cohort experienced a higher incidence of severe events vs p and the administration of chemotherapy or surgery was found to have increased the risk of death andor intensive care unit admission even after adjusting for age sex and comorbidities odds ratio or ci p while these studies are limited by small sample sizes the data suggests that cancer predisposes to more severe disease therefore since inperson contact increases the risk of transmission several institutions have mandated realtime video or telephone interactions alternatively referred to as telehealth77 postponed surgeries biopsies endoscopies scans and routine investigations when possible and in line with esmo guidelines78 encouraged conversion from the intravenous to the oral route eg 5fluorouracil to capecitabine etoposide and vinorelbine on the other hand the immediate existential threat of progressive disease for which death is an impending imminent certainty rather than a remote possibility in the absence of treatment likely outweighs the theoretical risk of sarscov2 infection even in lower risk disease for example in situ or localized prostate breast and head and neck cancer delayed treatment is 0c preproofpotentially conducive to tumor development and progression and thus may unfavorably impact prognosis79 hanna et al have proposed a triage strategy80 which prioritizes treatment for those patients with imminent risk of early mortality from acute leukemias aggressive lymphomas metastatic germ cell tumors oncologic emergencies such as spinal cord compression chemoradiotherapeuticresponsive cancers such as head and neck cervical and anal cancers and neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapyresponsive tumor types such as stage iii colon cancer and deprioritizes visits for surveillance and survivorship however in the absence of a one size fits all consensus recommendation which is unlikely since cancer is so genetically diverse and heterogeneous the decisionmaking process and the subsequent treatment plan are individualized and to be determined tbd on casebycase basis taking into account multiple factors including the risk of cancer recurrence if therapy is delayed modified or interrupted the type of therapy eg surgery radiation chemotherapy checkpoint inhibitors and stem cell transplantation extent of comorbidities concomitant medications patient preferences physicianpatient relationship race age the number of cycles of therapy completed and treatment tolerance in terms of specific cancerrelated conditions asco makes the following heavily qualified recommendations81 uf0b7 growth factor prophylaxis for neutropenia and neutropenic fever even at lower levels of risk as well as empiric antibiotics for acute care uf0b7 erythropoietinstimulating agents for anemia prophylaxis and transfusion when necessary depending on the patient context and underlying comorbidities preproof treatment based on the high transmissibility of the virus82 the main nonpharmacologic countermeasures to mitigate or delay the impact of covid19 include rigorous hand hygiene use of facemasks respiratory etiquette ie coughing or sneeze into the upper sleeve or elbow not the hands flushing with the lid down to prevent bioaerosolization as well as quarantine stay at home policies and workplace and school closures which have upended the social cultural political and economic status quo no specific treatment or vaccine is currently available although promising activity has been reported for hydroxychloroquine chloroquine arbidol remdesivir convalescent sera and favipiravir the mainstay of medical therapy includes symptomatic care such as supplemental oxygen antibiotics and hemodynamic and mechanical ventilatory support if indicated for septic shockmultiple an failure and respiratory failure respectively83 over active clinical treatment trials are underway84 these include vaccines as well as a number of different agents some with promising preliminary data as mentioned above and also those with potential anticancer activity which will hopefully serve a double purpose first to treat covid19 and second as an adjunct to bridge the time gap until the patient is recovered and the primary antineoplastic is startedrestarted as shown in table 0c preproof conclusions the alarming spread of the covid19 pandemic has disproportionately affected cancer patients an atrisk population both from the standpoint of increased disease severity and disruption to care which includes widespread suspension of clinical trials in the united states that are already fraught with barriers to enrollment and participation85 86because the symptoms of covid19 are nonspecific underlying symptoms from the cancer eg dyspnea cough fever fatigue diarrhea etc which overlap with those from the viral infection may obscure and delay the diagnosis hence if the covid19specific rapid reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rtpcr test is not readily available andor in short supply which is currently the case diagnosis will depend on the maintenance of a high index of clinical suspicion especially in advanced cancer patients who check all the boxes for risk factors such as older age frailty disability immunosuppression generalized systemic inflammation and multiple comorbidities eg hypertension diabetes and cardiorenovascular diseases that predispose to severe disease and death preproofthese comorbidities are commonly treated with renin angiotensin system blockers such as angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors aceis or angiotensinreceptor blockers arbs which increase levels of ace2 the continued use of aceisarbs is the centerpiece of an intense debate because on the one hand sarscov2 coopts ace2 for target cell entry but on the other ace2 overexpression may counterbalance vasoconstriction and profibrotic processes and thereby reduce the incidence or mortality associated with covid19 associated ali or acute respiratory distress syndrome another controversy involves whether or not to continue cancer treatment given the high transmissibility potential of the virus however since no expert consensus recommendations have been issued to date and prognosis stage and responses to therapy are highly heterogeneous the riskbenefit tradeoff and subsequent treatment plan are highly individualized and context dependent currently the focus of treatment is infection control appropriate symptomatic care and oxygen therapy no approved medication or vaccine has been developed but promising activity has been reported for hydroxychloroquine chloroquine arbidol remdesivir convalescent sera and favipiravir and several repurposed agents with antitumor properties are under investigation including thalidomide and rrx001 which may hopefully bridge the gap from the time covid is first diagnosed until the primary anticancer therapy is restarted finally multiple comparisons have been made between the allout mobilization efforts to combat covid19 with the massive scaleup of human and material resources that occurred during world war ii8788 in the words of winston churchill prime minister of great britain from whose intrepid fighting spirit iron will and intransigent defiance of tyranny galvanized the resolve of an entire nation to fight on in the face of seemingly impossible odds oncologists on the frontlines that have answered the call should never worry about action only

{"system": "You are a medical text classifier. Choose exactly one label.", "user": "Text: The overfitting characterizing AIC-selected models in scenarios of simple exposure lag response dependencies does not seriously affect its performance a result in line with previous findings 18. However AIC-selected models also suffer from bias and undercoverage of confidence intervals to some extent. Part of this seems to be related to the limited flexibility of the functions applied in the simulation study and may be described as a smoothing problem rather that an inherent limitation of the estimators. It should also be noted that the simulation study only evaluates a limited set of exposure response and lag response shapes simulated under the assumption of independency. Different functions such as cubic splines and more complex exposure lag response surfaces will be assessed in future simulation studies. Also an extension of DLNMs with penalized splines characterized by higher flexibility can be explored as well exploiting previous research on bivariate smoothing techniques 3031. A related problem is about the inferential procedures being conditional on a posteriori selection of the best-fitting model. Previous studies on unidimensional models have proposed a correction for the inflation of type I errors in tests on a constant effect along lags 1727. However this approach is not easily extended to the bidimensional setting of exposure lag response associations and the definition of a hypothesis testing procedure for DLNMs is left to future developments. Although a posteriori selection may also be a source of undercoverage of confidence intervals its impact seems to be limited if compared with that associated with lack of fit at least in the simple scenarios investigated in the simulation study. Another limitation is the lack of a formal testing procedure on the hypothesis of independency. As suggested in Section 3.4 a graphical assessment of the proportionality of exposure response and lag response curves such as those in can help investigating the issue. Further research is needed to provide more consistent inferential procedures in this setting. The analysis of the temporal evolution of the risk associated with protracted time-varying exposures has straightforward applications in different research fields. For example the DLNM methodology may be used to characterize the risk of chronic exposures to occupational or environmental factors to differentiate the role of exposures sustained at different ages in life course studies or to define the temporal frame of beneficial or adverse effects of drugs in clinical trials and pharmaco-epidemiology. The development of this methodology and software implementation provide a promising analytical tool for biomedical research. 6. Software and data All the analyses presented in this paper were performed using the R software version 3.0.1 32. The DLNM modeling framework is fully implemented in the package dlnm 25 by using the expressly extended version 2.0.0. The permutational algorithm for simulating time-to-event data in the presence of time-varying exposures is implemented in the package PermAlgo 29 version 1.0. Both packages are available through R from its central repository. The data of the Colorado Plateau uranium miners cohort in the form of a comma-separated values file is included in the supporting information together with the R scripts for the analysis performed in the example and the simulation study of Sections 3 4 which are entirely reproducible. In particular the script example.R provides a short illustration of the modeling framework. Versions of the scripts updated to future versions of the dlnm package will be available at http: www.ag-myresearch.com. Distributed lag non-linear models were originally conceived and developed for describing temperature health associations in time series data by Ben Armstrong. The data from the Colorado Plateau uranium miners cohort were collected by the researchers of National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. I am grateful to Bryan Langholz for kindly making data and documentation available. The simulation study was performed using the high-processing computing system at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. The final version of this has been substantially improved following the comments of an unknown reviewer.

increased response and improved survival when treated with erlotinib at the standard dose of 150 mg per day. The objective of this trial was to evaluate the association of the activity of erlotinib in the first-line setting in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with the development of a tolerable rash via dose escalation of erlotinib or tumor characteristics. Methods Patients with advanced NSCLC without prior systemic therapy were treated with erlotinib 150 mg orally per day. The dose was increased by 25 mg every two weeks until the development of grade 2 tolerable rash or other dose limiting toxicity. Tumor biopsy specimens were required for inclusion. Results The study enrolled 137 patients 135 were evaluable for safety and 124 were eligible and evaluable for response. Only 73 tumor samples were available for analysis. Erlotinib dose escalation occurred in 69 124 patients. Erlotinib was well tolerated with 70 of patients developing a grade 1 2 rash and 10 developing grade 3 rash. Response rate and disease control rate were 6.5 and 41.1 respectively. Median overall survival was 7.7 months. Toxicity and tumor markers were not associated with response. Grade 2 or greater skin rash and low pMAPK were associated with improved survival. Conclusions Overall survival was similar in this trial compared to first-line chemotherapy in this unselected patient population. Dose escalation to the development of grade 2 skin rash was associated with improved survival in this patient population.

For commercial re-use please contact journals.permissions oup.com Motivation: Identifying altered pathways in an individual is important for understanding disease mechanisms and for the future application of custom therapeutic decisions. Existing pathway analysis techniques are mainly focused on discovering altered pathways between normal and cancer groups and are not suitable for identifying the pathway aberrance that may occur in an individual sample. A simple way to identify individual s pathway aberrance is to compare normal and tumor data from the same individual. However the matched normal data from the same individual are often unavailable in clinical situation. Therefore we suggest a new approach for the personalized identification of altered pathways making special use of accumulated normal data in cases when a patient s matched normal data are unavailable. The philosophy behind our method is to quantify the aberrance of an individual sample's pathway by comparing it with accumulated normal samples. We propose and examine personalized extensions of pathway statistics overrepresentation analysis and functional class scoring to generate individualized pathway aberrance score. Results: Collected microarray data of normal tissue of lung and colon mucosa are served as reference to investigate a number of cancer individuals of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and colon cancer respectively. Our method concurrently captures known facts of cancer survival pathways and identifies the pathway aberrances that represent cancer differentiation status and survival. It also provides more improved validation rate of survival-related pathways than when a single cancer sample is interpreted in the context of cancer-only cohort. In addition our method is useful in classifying unknown samples into cancer or normal groups. Particularly we identified amino acid synthesis and interconversion pathway is a good indicator of LUAD (Area Under the Curve (AUC) 0.982 at independent validation). Clinical importance of the method is providing pathway interpretation of single cancer even though its matched normal data are unavailable.

The analysis of altered pathways in an individual cancer patient may help to understand the disease status and suggest customized anticancer therapies.It is straightforward to compare the molecular profile of an individual s tumor and normal cells to discover molecular aberrances specific to his her cancer. However it may not be feasible in the current clinical practice environment to perform a metastatic tumor biopsy at the time of treatment resistance in patients with advanced cancer (Dancey et al. 2012). A case study of custom-tailored medicine based on an individual s genome and transcriptome highlights this limitation (Jones et al. 2010). A patient s tumor had metastasized to the lung after surgery at the primary site. A biopsy from his lung tumor was analyzed by mutation and transcription profiling; however the patient s normal lung tissue was not biopsied. Because there was no matched normal tissue messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in the patient s own blood and information collected from various normal tissues were used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The results of pathway analysis based on DEGs integrated copy number variation and mutation information led the doctor to change the patient s drug treatment and the disease was stabilized for 3 months.Although the personalized interpretation of pathways can be demanding most current pathway analyses have been developed to investigate deregulated pathways between two phenotype groups. Khatri et al. (2012) classified these methods into three types: overrepresentation analysis (ORA) functional class scoring (FCS) and a pathway topology (PT)-based approach.ORA approaches typically apply an arbitrary threshold value (e.g. fold change 2 or P 0.05) on gene expression to assess whether the number of genes beyond threshold are significantly over- or underrepresented in the given pathway. There are two drawbacks to ORA. First it uses only the most significant genes and discards others thus resulting in information loss for marginally significant genes (Breitling et al. 2004). Second it considers only the number of genes and does not consider the magnitude of expression changes leading to information loss regarding the importance of genes (e.g. a gene with a fold change of 2.01 and a gene with a fold change of 4 are considered equally). Unlike ORA FCS methods do not discard genes with an arbitrary threshold but use all available genes which is an improvement over ORA (Tian et al. 2005). PT methods are essentially based on FCS methods with the addition that they consider network topology information. They compensate for the common limitation of ORA and FCS in reporting false-positive gene sets due to sets of overlapping genes. In our we focus on ORA and FCS methods extending and implementing each for personalized pathway analysis.There are two exceptional studies examining individualized pathway analysis (Drier et al. 2013; Vaske et al. 2010). PARADIGM is a tool that infers a pathway status by using known functional structures. The method models the functional structure of pathway as a set of interconnected variables where the variables are omic objects such as DNA mRNA and protein where the interaction between variables describes the functional status of a pathway. PARADIGM may perform better with multiple omics as it uses known functional relationships between a gene or inter-gene DNA and protein. Hence it might not perform well with single layer omic data such as from mRNA microarrays.Drier et al. (2013) proposed a personal pathway deregulation score (PDS) which represents the distance of a single cancer sample from the median of normal samples on the principal curve. To calculate PDS they reduced the dimensions by principal component analysis and found the best principal curve using entire cohort samples containing both normal and or different stages of cancers. Drier s method performs better than PARADIGM in the mRNA only datasets of brain and colon cancers. Calculating PDS requires data dependent preprocessing steps including selecting the number of principal components to be used and filtering out noisy gene data to obtain optimized principal curves. PDS fully uses whole cohort data to interpret an individual s pathway which can be a drawback in that it requires a number of cohort data to extract principal curve to interpret a single patient data. It has a limitation to interpret a single sample such as a patient s recurrent tumor that is not accompanied with cohort dataset to extract the principal curve.Our proposed method is based on the comparison of one cancer sample with many accumulated normal samples (we use nRef to refer to the accumulated normal samples) that is different from the previous studies in following sense. The proposed method is suitable to adopt single-layer omics data and expendable to interpret a patient in the context of many published or user-defined pathway gene sets. PARADIGM has less freedom in terms of data and gene sets as it prefers multi-layered omics data and requires predefined functional structure among omics objects. Unlike PDS which extracts the principal curve from entire cohort data our method does not assume an individual sample belongs to a cohort. We introduce using accumulated normal tissue data as a reference. This is a simple and biologically intuitive guideline in such a case to interpret a single sample that lack cohort data.Our method provides a series of analysis steps which consists of four parts: data processing gene-level statistics individualized pathway aberrance score (iPAS) and a significance test. To discover the most feasible method for iPAS we extend existing pathway analysis techniques namely ORA and FCS to properly reflect the nature of testing one cancer to many normal samples.To demonstrate that iPAS captures biologically and clinically relevant information in a sensible valid and useful manner we apply it to samples of lung and colon adenocarcinoma. We show that our representation generates clinically relevant stratifications and outcome predictors which would not have been achieved when the same data are analyzed by the conventional method that does not use accumulated normal data.Our empirical study suggests two different strategies depending on the biological question that iPAS is focused on. In the case of cancer diagnosis a method that uses the inter-gene correlation structure of the accumulated normal samples performs best. In the case of cancer prognosis a simple averaging of all member genes standardized gene expression values performs best.2 METHODS AND MATERIALS2.1 Gene expression dataWe built nRef by the manual curation of data obtained from NCBI GEO (Barrett et al. 2012). Microarray data of adjacent normal tissues obtained from patients undergoing surgery were selected to serve as the nRef. Data from biopsied samples primary cultures of normal tissues and post-mortem donors were not included in the nRef. We collected 120 nRef for lung 60 from GSE19804 (Lu et al. 2011) 27 from GSE7670 (Su et al. 2007) and 33 from GSE10072 (Landi et al. 2008). Samples came from individuals with variable smoking histories and different ethnic backgrounds. We collected 101 nRef for colon concentrating on normal mucosa tissue samples from six datasets available at GEO. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method in survival analysis we used Beer s data of 442 lung adenocarcinomas (LUADs) (Beer et al. 2002) to discover survival-related pathways and validated the associations of 61 LUAD samples of GSE8894 (Lee et al. 2008). The pathway based identification of LUAD were tested on 120 cancers and 120 normal samples of GSE19804 GSE7670 and GSE10071. Further validation was conducted with 48 cancers and 35 normal samples collected from GSE19188 (Hou et al. 2010) and GSE31547. For patient stratification by colon cancer differentiation status we used 566 microarrays of GSE39582 (Marisa et al. 2013) which provided in a separate manner 443 for discovery 123 for validation. GSE17536 (Smith et al. 2010) was also used for validation.2.2 Pathway dataInformation from gene sets representing biological pathways were obtained from REACTOME (Croft et al. 2011) which are also provided in the Molecular Signature Database (Subramanian et al. 2005). Pathways with small number of genes are more easily understood by human experts. We decided to filter out pathways of which gene set size is 97. The cutoff covers at least 80 of contents of each public pathway resources. Of 674 pathways in REACTOME 583 pathways (86.7 ) remained after filtering by the gene set size.2.3 Individualized analysis using the nRefThe aim of our approach is to identify altered pathways in an individual by making use of the nRef. A schematic diagram of our method of individualized pathway analysis is described in Figure 1 and the following sections describe each step. Fig. 1.Schematic description of individualized pathway analysis using accumulated normal data (nRef). An individual s tumor data are normalized with the nRef. Gene expression is standardized by mean and SD of the nRef. The iPAS is calculated from standardized gene expression values in the pathway. Null distribution calculated from the nRef provides significance2.3.1 Data preprocessing and gene-level statisticsExpression level was defined by using the robust multichip average (Irizarry et al. 2003). For datasets using different microarrays only those with probes in common from Affymetrix U133A to Affymetrix U133Plus 2.0 were used for further analysis. For individual tumor cases we performed quantile normalization (Bolstad et al. 2003) after combining the single tumor microarray with all nRef samples. In cases of genes with multiple probes gene expression level was summarized by averaging probe-level expression. Individual tumor sample gene expression was standardized using the mean and standard deviation of the reference.2.3.2\nLabels: [Thyroid_Cancer, Colon_Cancer, Lung_Cancer]\nReply with one label only.", "assistant": "Lung_Cancer"}

The graph shows the effect of the treatments with 5 µM cisplatin and 40 nM siMSLN-1 used as single agents or in combination. On day 6 MANOVA shows a statistically significant effect both for cisplatin (P? ?0.0168) and siMSLN-1 (P 10?4) in reducing proliferation. However the interaction term for the effect of both agents in combination is not statistically significant (P? ?0.145). Error bars represent SEM of three independent experiments each performed in quadruplicate. B. Flow cytometry analysis. The graph shows the percentage of cells in phase S G2 M in Mero-14 cells treated with 40 nM of the siCtrl or siMSLN-1 in combination with imatinib (25 µM) or gemcitabine (1 µM) (alone) or imatinib gemcitabine (10 µM and 1 µM respectively). The transfection with siMSLN-1 was accompanied with a marked decrease of cells in S G2 M phase as compared with the respective cultures transfected with siCtrl irrespectively of the drugs employed (P? ? 0.00033). Error bars represent SEM of two independent experiments. C. Caspase activity measured on Mero-14 cells transfected with 40 nM of siCtrl or siMSLN-1 with or without cisplatin 5 µM. A marked increase in apoptosis is observed when siMSLN-1 and cisplatin are administered together compared to cultures treated with cisplatin and transfected with siCtrl ( P? ?0.018) suggesting a synergistic effect. Error bars represent SEM of three independent experiments each performed in triplicate. D. Western blotting analysis of MSLN p53 and PARP under different combinations of siRNAs and cisplatin (at 5 10 and 20 µM). ?-actin was used as reference. The protein levels were confirmed with three independent experiments.

Role of MSLN in cell cycle progression and apoptosis following treatments with chemotherapeutic drugs Following flow cytometry analysis Mero-14 cells treated with siMSLN-1 in combination with cisplatin or imatinib or gemcitabine (each as a single agent) or imatinib gemcitabine showed a statistically significant decreased share of cells in S G2 M phase as compared to their respective cultures where siMSLN-1 were replaced with siCtrl (B). This finding further confirmed the activity of siMSLN-1 in slowing the progression through cell cycle. In treatments where siRNA was combined with chemotherapeutic drugs activities of caspases-3 and -7 were measured as markers for apoptosis. The addition of siMSLN-1 in cultures treated with imatinib or gemcitabine (each as a single agent) or imatinib gemcitabine was not associated with an increased rate of apoptosis as compared to cultures treated with the chemotherapeutic drugs together with siCtrl. Interestingly a synergistic effect was observed when cisplatin was used in combination with siMSLN-1. In fact siMSLN-1 or cisplatin alone did not induce apoptosis whereas they markedly (and in a statistically significant way) induced increased apoptosis rates when used together (C). This observation was further corroborated by the induction of p53 and by the cleavage of PARP both additional markers for apoptosis (D). The effect was dose-dependent and visible from 5 µM of cisplatin. Discussion The present work provides evidence on the importance of MSLN for cell growth and invasiveness in MPM. The transient MSLN-silencing caused a decrease in the proliferation rate of the MSLN-overexpressing cell line Mero-14. These data are in agreement with those observed on PC cells 24 . Similar findings were also reported by Wang et al. in the MSLN-overexpressing MPM cell lines H2373 25 . As with the H2373 MPM cells the substantial arrest of the proliferation rate observed in the Mero-14 cells was underlined by the shift of the phosphorylation status of AKT and ERK (used as a marker of proliferation). The results on MPM cells were in agreement with the findings observed in PC and OC cells 25 suggesting that all the MSLN-expressing cancer cells show a significant loss of viability upon MSLN depletion. In addition to the reduced proliferation Mero-14 cells also showed a reduced capacity of sphere formation in a three-dimensional context. Concerning the cell cycle a significant increase (50 ) of MPM H2373 cells in the S-phase was observed portraying a blockade in progression from S to G2 phase 25 . The results obtained in Mero-14 cells were different since a reduction of cells in S-phase was observed paralleling an increase of cells in G1 phase. The differences could be ascribed to the different methods of siRNA administration (electroporation in H2373 versus chemical transfection in Mero-14) involving different time of observation (48 versus 72 hours respectively). However the overall decrease of cells in G2 M was consistent in both cell lines. Moreover a significant reduction in invasiveness was observed in both Mero-14 and H2373 cells in the trans-well assay. With regard to apoptosis no assays were reported for H2373. In general MPM cell lines are quite refractory to undergo apoptosis and this was also observed in Mero-14 cells after MSLN depletion or a treatment with cisplatin. By contrast MSLN silencing was able to promote apoptosis in PC AsPC-1 Capan-1 and Capan-2 cells 24 . However MSLN depletion triggered a marked increase in apoptosis in Mero-14 cells when used in combination with cisplatin thereby suggesting a synergistic effect. In Mero-14 cells the activation of caspases-3 and 7 was associated with the induction of p53 and with the cleavage of PARP both markers of a pro-apoptotic activity. In summary paralleling previous studies our findings confirm that MSLN should not be regarded only as an interesting diagnostic marker for MPM or a promising target for immunotherapies. Despite the limited knowledge on the biological role of MSLN in normal and cancer cells MSLN should also be considered a key molecular target for novel gene-based targeted therapies of cancer.

Background This retrospective study aims to assess the usefulness of SUVmax from FDG-PET imaging as a prognosticator for primary biopsy-proven stage I NSCLC treated with SBRT. Methods This study includes 95 patients of median age 77 years with primary biopsy-confirmed peripheral stage IA IB NSCLC. All patients were treated with 60Gy in 3 fractions with a median treatment time of six days. Local regional and distant failures were evaluated independently according to the terms of RTOG1021. Local regional and distant control overall- and progression-free survival were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to determine whether SUVmax age KPS gender tumor size T stage or smoking history influenced outcomes. SUVmax was evaluated as both a continuous and as a dichotomous variable using a cutoff of 5 and ?5. Results Median follow-up for the cohort was 16 months. Median OS and PFS were 25.3 and 40.3 months respectively. SUV with a cutoff value of 5 predicted for OS and PFS (p? ?.024 for each) but did not achieve significance for LC (p? ?.256). On Cox univariate regression analysis SUV as a dichotomous variable predicted for both OS and PFS (p? ?.027 and p? ?.030 respectively). Defined as a continuous variable SUVmax continued to predict for OS and PFS (p? ?.032 and p? ?.003) but also predicted LC (p? ?.045) and trended toward significance for DC (p? ?.059). SUVmax did not predict for OS as a dichotomous or continuous variable. It did however predict for PFS as a continuous variable (p? ?.008) neared significance for local control (p? ?.057) and trended towards significance for distant control (p? ?.092). Conclusions SUVmax appears to be a statistically and clinically significant independent prognostic marker for progression-free survival in patients with stage I NSCLC treated with SBRT. Prospective studies to more accurately define the role of tumor FDG uptake in the prognosis of NSCLC are warranted. Introduction 18?F -Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) is an important tool in the initial staging and subsequent assessment of patients diagnosed and treated for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 12 . FDG-PET imaging relies on the functional properties that define malignancies including increased glucose metabolism. This uptake is linked to tumor proliferation and metastatic potential and recent investigations demonstrate the usefulness of PET imaging as a prognosticator for eventual outcomes. The International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) reviewed 21 studies that assessed the utility of the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) in NSCLC and determined that tumors with higher SUVmax have poorer prognoses 3 . Other recent studies have attempted to determine the utility of SUVmax under a more narrow scope including that of early-stage NSCLC treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) an emerging technique typically reserved for patients who are medically-inoperable or who refuse surgery 45 . Multiple studies demonstrate that pretreatment SUVmax predicts for clinical outcomes in patients with early-stage NSCLC treated with SBRT 6-8 . To the contrary studies from Cleveland Clinic and Indiana University failed to find a correlation between pre-treatment SUVmax and survival 910 . As early-stage NSCLC is a potentially curable disease with SBRT here an SUVmax cutoff that predicts for more aggressive disease in patients with solitary peripheral primary stage I NSCLC is identified. Methods and materials Patients and workup This study includes 95 non-consecutive patients treated for biopsy-confirmed peripheral stage IA IB between October 2005 and May 2011 11 . This research was determined to have exemption status by our Institutional Review Board. All patients were staged according to the 7th edition of the AJCC criteria. No tumor was located within 2 cm of the proximal bronchial tree and no patient was previously treated for lung cancer. All patients had a pre-SBRT FDG-PET-CT scan with a documented SUVmax. Of these patients 14 were operable candidates but refused surgical therapy while the remaining 81 patients had significant pulmonary or cardiac comorbidity that precluded definitive surgical management (Table 1). As a part of the staging all patients underwent a PET-CT scan. The SUVmax was obtained from review of the formally dictated radiology report. Table 1 Patient characteristics n? ?95 Median Age 77 (48-91) years Sex Male 49 (51.6 ) Female 46 (48.4 ) Operable 14 (14.7 ) Inoperable 81 (85.3 ) KPS 80-100 63 (66.3 ) 70 32 (32.7 ) Clinical follow-up 16.33 (1.13-64.2) months Simulation and treatment Each patient was positioned supine with arms raised above the head for the CT simulation. A thin-slice 4-D high resolution CT (2.5 mm) and 1.25 mm helical CT with intravenous contrast was obtained while the patient was immobilized in a custom BodyFIX vacuum bag (Electa). For patients treated with CyberKnife Synchrony Respiratory Tracking System (Accuray Inc Sunnyvale CA) was utilized in conjunction with the 4D-CT to ensure fiducial movement in sync with the GTV. For Trilogy and Trubeam patients image-guided respiratory cycle motion was accounted for via Varian Real-Time Position Management System (Varian Medical Systems Palo Alto CA). Respiratory gating was incorporated for patients with tumor motion? ?0.5 cm. The acquired images were then transferred to the treatment planning workstation using either Accuray MulitPLAN (Accuray Inc Sunnyvale CA) or Varian Eclipse (Varian Medical Systems Palo Alto CA). The AAA planning algorithm was utilized for patients treated on Trilogy and Trubeam and the pencil beam algorithm for patients treated on CyberKnife . The tumor volume and any surrounding critical structures including the spinal cord heart esophagus brachial plexus and normal lung were manually delineated by a radiosurgical team consisting of a radiation oncologist a medical physicist and a thoracic surgeon. The gross tumor volume (GTV) was defined as the tumor alone. To account for setup error and residual motion detected on end-exhalation 4D-CT a minimum expansion of 5 mm margin was added to create the planning target volume (PTV). An additional margin based on motion assessment was added to create an internal target volume (ITV) to be used with gating. Dose-volume histograms were calculated for the target volume and nearby critical structures to select the optimal treatment plan which provided at least 95 of the prescription dose to the PTV while sparing surrounding organs-at-risk. If surrounding organs-at-risk were deemed to be at excess risk for toxicity a plan with lower PTV coverage was accepted. SBRT was performed using CyberKnife Robotic Radiosurgery System (Accuray Inc Sunnyvale CA for 39 patients Trilogy Radiosurgery System (Varian Medical Systems Palo Alto CA) for 54 patients and Trubeam Radiosurgery System (Varian Medical Systems Palo Alto CA) for 2 patients. All lesions were treated with heterogeneity correction to 60 Gy in 3 fractions every other day with a median of 6 elapsed days from beginning of treatment to end (range 3-21 days). For patients treated on the Trilogy and Trubeam platforms cone-beam CT (CBCT) was performed daily to separate setup error from tumor reposition error. The treating physician checked and modified the alignment based on target relocalization in the fused imaging. Disease assessment and clinical follow-Up After treatment patients were scheduled to have either a CT or PET CT scan every 3 months with a clinical evaluation. Response to treatment was evaluated by the RECIST v1.1 criteria and documented as a complete response partial response (greater than 30 decrease in the longest axis) progressive disease (greater than 20 increase in the longest axis) or stable disease (neither partial response nor progressive disease) 12 . Follow-up imaging was re-evaluated to classify local regional and distant failures similar to the definitions of RTOG 1021 13 . Local failures were defined as recurrence within the originally involved lobe or within 2 cm of the initial primary but located outside the originally involved lobe. Regional failure included non-involved ipsilateral lobes as well as ipsilateral hilar mediastinal and subcarinal lymph nodes. Distant failures enveloped ipsilateral supraclavicular and contralateral lymph nodes and all other distant sites. Progression-free survival was defined as the time to a specified recurrence and was measured from the last day of treatment to that event. Death was not included as an endpoint for PFS. Local regional and distant control overall- and progression-free survival were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. The ANOVA test was utilized to determine correlations between SUVmax tumor histology and stage. Forward conditional Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to determine whether SUVmax (continuous dichotomous) age (continuous) KPS (continuous) gender tumor T stage tumor histology or smoking pack years (continuous) influenced outcomes. SUVmax was evaluated in univariate and multivariate analyses as both a continuous and as a dichotomous variable using a cutoff of 5 and ?5 as described in previous reports 691415 . All statistics were completed using SPSS version 20 (IBM Corp Armonk NY). Significance was set at p???0.05. Results A total of 95 patients with a median age 77 years (range: 48-91 years) were identified between October 2005 and May 2011 (Table 1). All patients had biopsy-confirmed NSCLC with 38 (40 ) having squamous cell carcinoma and 33 (34.7 ) having adenocarcinoma.\nLabels: [Thyroid_Cancer, Colon_Cancer, Lung_Cancer]\nReply with one label only.", "assistant": "Lung_Cancer"}

Leading European groups in the fields of EQA Pathology and Medical and Thoracic Oncology collaborated in a pilot EQA scheme for somatic epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutational analysis in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods: EQA samples generated from cell lines mimicking clinical samples were provided to participating laboratories each with a mock clinical case. Participating laboratories performed the analysis using their usual method(s). Anonymous results were assessed and made available to all participants. Two subsequent EQA rounds followed the pilot scheme. Results: One hundred and seventeen labs from 30 countries registered and 91 returned results. Sanger sequencing and a commercial kit were the main methodologies used. The standard of genotyping was suboptimal with a significant number of genotyping errors made. Only 72 out of 91 (72 ) participants passed the EQA. False-negative and -positive results were the main sources of error. The quality of reports submitted was acceptable; most were clear concise and easy to read. However some participants reported the genotyping result in the absence of any interpretation and many obscured the interpretation required for clinical care. Conclusions: Even in clinical laboratories the technical performance of genotyping in EGFR mutation testing for NSCLC can be improved evident from a high level of diagnostic errors. Robust EQA can contribute to global optimisation of EGFR testing for NSCLC patients. non-small-cell lung carcinoma EGFR gene mutations quality assessment Assessment of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations has become mandatory to choose the most active first-line treatment for patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Indeed randomized phase III clinical trials have demonstrated that first-line administration of an EGFR TKI results in a prolonged progression-free survival as compared with chemotherapy in patients carrying EGFR mutations (Mok et al 2009; Maemondo et al 2010; Mitsudomi et al 2010; Fukuoka et al 2011; Zhou et al 2011; Rosell et al 2012). These studies have also confirmed that EGFR mutations are a reliable marker that predicts sensitivity to EGFR TKIs (Mok et al 2009). Activating mutations occur in exons 18 through 21 of the TK domain of the EGFR gene and either point mutations or in-frame small deletions or insertions (Sharma et al 2007; De Luca and Normanno 2010). Although more than 250 mutations of the EGFR gene have been described to date two mutations a single point mutation in exon 21 the L858R and a series of small in-frame deletions in exon 19 account for ?90 of all EGFR mutations (Sharma et al 2007; Linardou et al 2008). EGFR mutations are strongly associated with defined clinical and pathological features: they are far more frequent in female patients as compared with male; in adenocarcinoma as compared with other histological types; in non-smokers as compared with current smokers or former smokers; and in East-Asian NSCLC patients as compared with Non-East-Asian patients (Normanno et al 2006). External quality assessment (EQA) is a system of objectively checking laboratory results by an independent external agency (van Krieken et al 2013). The main objective of an EQA programme is to establish inter-laboratory comparability. In this respect the EQA process can identify latent systematic errors in methodology that may not be revealed by a laboratory's own internal QA processes. Representatives from ETOP ESMO ESP EMQN and other leading European groups met in July 2010 to discuss a pan-European approach to EQA for EGFR mutation testing in NSCLC. In this paper we present the results of this pilot EQA scheme for EGFR testing that was completed in 2013. Materials and Methods anisation of the scheme A meeting was anised in July 2010 by ETOP and EMQN to bring together a group of professionals representing EMQN ESP ETOP ESMO and other leading European groups involved in NSCLC testing (see Supplementary Information). From this group a steering group of five individuals was formed who planned designed and assessed the results of the pilot EQA scheme. The scheme was coordinated and administered by the EMQN and three rounds were anised within a period of 18 months. The workflow of the scheme process is shown in . Validation of samples The primary aim of this scheme was to develop a flexible scalable EQA scheme designed to assess issues related to techniques and minimum detection limits used in standard laboratory practice focusing exclusively on the analytical (that is sample processing genotyping) and reporting phases (interpretation of the results in relation to the clinical context). To enable this and to avoid the significant challenges of sample heterogeneity in real tissue samples 20 artificial materials were used composed of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) cell line samples. These EQA materials were designed to mimic real tissue samples as closely as possible and contained homogenous mixtures of mutant vs wild-type cell lines at a range of different allelic ratios. The paraffin blocks were cut and 10??m sections placed in eppendorf tube at the Pathology department of the VU University Medical Centre in Amsterdam The Netherlands by Dr Erik Thunnissen. H E (4??m) sections were used to estimate the number of tumour cells. In each EQA sample section at least 200 nuclei were present (usually 300) roughly mimicking the amount of cells from a small NSCLC biopsy. For each EQA sample one 10-?m-thick section was sent by EMQN to each of the three validating laboratories for mutational analysis in a blinded fashion. Different sections from the block were analysed for EGFR mutation status to ensure that the mutation was homogeneously represented within each block. The validating laboratories independently analysed the samples by using three different approaches: direct sequencing of the PCR product for exons 18 21 mutations; fragment analysis for exon 19 deletions and an allelic discrimination-based real-time PCR assay for the L858R mutation in exon 21; and the Therascreen EGFR RGQ kit (Qiagen Hilden Germany) reporting the results directly to the EMQN. The allelic ratios of mutations in each sample used in rounds 2 and 3 were accurately quantified by a commercial sponsor (Horizon Diagnostics Cambridge UK) using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) on a BioRad QX100 (Hercules CA USA) platform. Genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted from FFPE sections on the Promega (Madison WI USA) Maxwell System using the Maxwell 16 FFPE Plus LEV DNA purification kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. Quantification was performed using a Promega QuantiFluor dsDNA assay kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. ddPCR was performed using Taqman custom SNP 40 primer probe assays (Life Technologies Carlsbad CA USA) to assess the frequency of each mutation with the exception of the p.(E746_A750) assay which was designed in-house. DNA (40?ng) was added to each ddPCR reaction. Reactions were performed in quadruplicate and droplets were generated using a Droplet Generator according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR was performed on a standard thermocycler using previously optimised assay-specific cycling conditions. Droplets were analysed using a QX100 Droplet Reader as described in the manufacturer's instructions. Data from at least 45?000 useable droplets were collected for each sample. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded reference standards (Horizon Diagnostics) were included as assay controls. Registration of participant laboratories and shipment of samples Laboratories that performed EGFR mutational analysis were invited to participate in the EQA via an open call from the EMQN in conjunction with the ESP ETOP and ESMO. Participating laboratories registered via the EMQN website (European Molecular Genetics Quality Network (EMQN) 2014) and were requested to perform DNA extraction and analysis using their routine method. In each round 10 samples (one 10-?m-thick section for each) with accompanying mock clinical referral information were sent to participating laboratory. Each laboratory was identified only by a unique EMQN ID code to avoid exchange of information between participants and minimise bias in the results' interpretation process. The laboratories were given 8 weeks to complete their analyses and to submit the results of genotyping to the EMQN website. The centres were requested to provide information on the technique used for mutational analysis and metrics relating to their experience of performing EGFR mutational analyses. Evaluation of results The scheme included three rounds: the first was restricted to a maximum of 30 labs to establish proof of principle and validate the materials. A subsequent second round of the scheme was anised with no restriction on participation. Laboratories that failed the second round were provided with another set of samples in a restricted third round. The steering group evaluated the results according to a pre-defined scoring system. The scoring system assigned two points to correct genotype and zero points to false-positive or -negative results (Table 1). Errors in mutation nomenclature that might lead to misinterpretation of the results (for example stating deletion' without specifying the exon in which the deletion occurs) were assigned 1.50 points. This deduction was applied only once for each center generally to the first sample for which the error was found. One point was awarded for cases in which the genotype was mispositioned or miscalled: this error sometimes occurs with exon 19 deletions for which it might be difficult to define the precise base or amino acid in which the deletion starts or ends. If a test failed giving no result on the sample (analytical failure) then the lab received 1.00 point for that sample. The threshold to pass the EQA was set at a total score for the 10 samples of ?18 out of 20 (Thunnissen et al 2011) laboratories with a genotyping score 18 were classified as poor performers (applied to rounds 2 and 3 only). Performance in the assessment of clinical interpretation and reporting did not contribute to poor performance. Results Selection of the samples for the EQA The first step of the EQA scheme was the selection and the validation of the samples. Twenty materials were manufactured by Dr Thunnissen by mixing four lung cancer cell lines (A549 EGFR wild type) H1650 (EGFR p.(E746_A750del) H1975 (EGFR p.(T790M) p.(L858R)) and SW48 (p.G719S). Cell lines with mutations were serially diluted into A549 or SIHA cells at different ratios relevant to establishing the analytical sensitivity of the tests used by labs. Each material was validated in three different reference laboratories using different techniques to confirm the genotype and the results showed that the mutations were detectable at all the designated ratios dependent on the technology used (Table 2). A good yield of gDNA was obtained from all the samples. In addition there was complete concordance on the EGFR mutational status of the selected specimens and therefore all were selected for use in the quality assessment scheme with samples A1 A10 used for the pilot and B1 10 and C1 C10 in subsequent rounds 2 and 3. To accurately establish quantitative measurements of the allelic frequencies of the EGFR mutations all 10 EQA samples (Table 2; samples B C1 B C10) used in rounds 2 and 3 were analysed on a ddPCR platform (BioRad QX100). Three of the samples had allelic frequencies higher than expected (C3 C8 and C9) two were lower (C2 and C10) and in one (C5) it was not possible to establish the true value due to insufficient availability of sample material (Table 3). First round proof of principle pilot scheme Twenty-nine laboratories registered from 13 countries and 25 participated in the pilot EQA scheme (4 labs withdrew due to customs sample importation problems) which was run in fourth quarter of 2011. A set of 10 samples were sent to the laboratories (Table 2; samples A1 A10). All the participating laboratories submitted results within the 8-week time frame. The main methodology used by the participants was PCR sequencing (n 10 laboratories; 34 ) and real-time PCR (n 10; 34 ) (Figure 2). Two analytical errors (false-negative results) were observed. A further five laboratories made process errors (sample swaps) that resulted in an additional 24 genotype errors. In all cases the genotypes were correct but reported for the wrong sample. Therefore 92 of the false-negative results were concentrated in five laboratories. No false-positive results were reported. The materials performed well and there were no analytical test failures. As this was designed to ascertain proof of principle we did not apply a measure of successful laboratory performance. The pilot established that the scheme design and methods used were acceptable for use in a larger scheme. Second round One hundred and seventeen laboratories from 30 countries registered and 101 participated in the second round (due to customs issues we were not able to get samples to 16 labs) run in the second quarter of 2012. Ninety-one laboratories submitted results within the 8-week time frame the remaining 10 labs gave no reason why they did not submit results. A different set of samples from those used in the pilot first round were sent to the laboratories with the emphasis being on the inclusion of mutations at allelic frequencies that would challenge the analytical sensitivity of all the commonly used technologies (Table 2; samples B1 B10). A code number different from the one assigned in the first round was given to the samples. In addition to the genotype results all participating laboratories were also required to submit for assessment copies of their clinical reports for three samples (B1 B4 and B9). The main methodology used by the participants was PCR sequencing (n 35 laboratories; 39 ) and real-time PCR (n 17; 18.6 Figure 2). It was common for labs to use a combination of different methodologies in their testing process (Table 4). A variety of different errors were detected by the second scheme round including 74 (8.1 ) genotype errors (false-positive (n 13; 1.5 ) false-negative (n 61; 82.4 ) and a combination of false-negative and -positive results (n 1; 1.4 )) as well as analytical test failures (n 31; 3.4 ) mispositioning of the genotype (n 7; 0.8 ) and significant errors in the mutation nomenclature (n 36; 3.9 ). Two samples (B2 and B8) gave a disproportionately high error rate compared with the other samples used in this round (Table 5) with 94.1 of errors for B2 made by labs using PCR sequencing vs 40.7 of errors for sample B8 made by labs using a version of the Therascreen EGFR kit (Qiagen). Laboratories did not lose marks if the declared limitations of their assay meant that they would not detect a particular mutation at the given frequency used in the EQA materials. Eighteen laboratories (19.8 ) from 13 countries with a total score below 18 did not pass the second round and were thus classified as poor performers 72.2 of these labs used PCR Sequencing as their main diagnostic test for EGFR mutation status. The interpretation of the test result relative to the clinical referral was reviewed with laboratories receiving comments on their performance but no marks assigned. Overall 46 (50.5 ) of the laboratories had a score ?18 in the second round and passed the EQA. All laboratories received a certificate of participation that displayed their performance in the scheme. Third round The 18 laboratories that did not pass the second round were given the opportunity to participate in a third round. One laboratory was unable to participate due to problems with customs sample import permissions.

The objective response rate was significantly lower in patients with uncommon EGFR mutations compared with the objective response rate in those with common EGFR mutations when treated with gefitinib (20 versus 76 ; p 0.017) (supplementary Table S2 Supplemental Digital Content 1 http: links.lww.com JTO A494). By contrast similar objective response rates were observed for patients with uncommon EGFR mutations and those with common EGFR mutations in the carboplatin-paclitaxel group (20 versus 32 ; p 0.336) (supplementary Table S2 Supplemental Digital Content 1 http: links.lww.com JTO A494). FIGURE 3. Progression-free survival curves in the gefitinib group (A) and the carboplatin-paclitaxel group (B) according to the type of epidermal growth factor receptor mutation. DISCUSSION Recent studies suggest that NSCLC patients with uncommon EGFR mutations are less responsive to EGFR-TKIs compared with patients with L858R and exon 19 deletions.9 20 However the efficacy of EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC patients with uncommon mutations has not been fully elucidated. We conducted a post-hoc analysis of the NEJ002 study to evaluate the effectiveness of gefitinib against NSCLC with G719X or L861Q. The NEJ002 study comparing gefitinib and standard carboplatin-paclitaxel chemotherapy as the first-line treatment for patients with EGFR mutations demonstrated no significant difference in OS between gefitinib and carboplatin-paclitaxel.6 In contrast to other phase 3 trials investigating EGFR-TKIs for patients with common EGFR mutations of exon 19 deletion and L858R the NEJ002 is the only study that included uncommon EGFR mutations of G719X and L861Q. The current study clearly demonstrated that NSCLC patients with the uncommon EGFR mutations G719X and L861Q had shorter survival than the survival of those with an exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation (Fig. 2). Our results are consistent with other clinical studies on EGFR-TKIs in patients with uncommon EGFR mutations (supplementary Table S3 Supplemental Digital Content 1 http: links.lww.com JTO A494). The overall response rate to EGFR-TKIs in patients with uncommon EGFR mutations was 41 which is lower than the response rate to TKIs (62 83 ) of patients with common EGFR mutations.7824 In the NEJ002 study G719X included G719C and G719S. No patients harbored G719A. To investigate the effectiveness of gefitinib on each uncommon EGFR mutations we evaluated the difference in OS between patients with uncommon EGFR mutations (G719C versus G719S and G719X versus L861Q). There was no significant difference between these subgroups (data not shown). This study showed that the PFS and OS tended to be shorter among patients treated with first-line gefitinib compared with PFS and OS among those treated with first-line carboplatin-paclitaxel in the uncommon EGFR mutation group (supplementary Table S2 Supplemental Digital Content 1 http: links.lww.com JTO A494). We also found poor disease control rate with gefitinib in patients with uncommon mutations. Three of five patients with uncommon mutations in the gefitinib group had progressive disease. By contrast no patients with uncommon mutations had progressive disease in the carboplatin-paclitaxel group. Although the number of patients with uncommon mutations in each treatment group was small platinum-doublet therapy might be a better choice than gefitinib for first-line therapy in patients with uncommon EGFR mutations. Because some of patients with uncommon mutations showed good clinical response to gefitinib in this study and they seemed to be heterogeneous in terms of response to gefitinib administration of gefitinib should be considered for patients with uncommon mutations when disease progression was observed after first-line chemotherapy. In vitro studies have indicated that the affinity of gefitinib for EGFR proteins with uncommon EGFR mutations is lower than the affinity of gefitinib for EGFR proteins with common EGFR mutations.25 A sixfold or 14-fold higher concentration of gefitinib was required to inhibit the growth of cells expressing G719X or L861Q respectively compared with cells expressing L858R.26 These results may explain the lack of response to gefitinib in patients with uncommon EGFR mutations. The authors also examined the sensitivity of G719X and L861Q mutations to erlotinib and irreversible TKIs.27 Cells expressing G719X were less resistant to erlotinib than gefitinib in vitro; however L861Q was resistant to both erlotinib and gefitinib. In contrast to erlotinib irreversible TKIs inhibited the growth of cells with G719X or L861Q at a lower concentration than those with wild-type EGFR. Indeed Sequist et al.28 reported that the effectiveness of an irreversible pan-ErbB receptor TKI neratinib on NSCLC patients with G719X. Niratinib induced partial responses in three of four patients with G719X and the fourth had durable stable disease for 40 weeks. It may be beneficial to evaluate erlotinib as a treatment for NSCLCs with G719X and irreversible EGFR-TKIs as treatments for NSCLCs with G719X and L861Q. Because previous phase 3 trials that investigated erlotinib or irreversible TKIs for NSCLC with EGFR mutations did not include uncommon EGFR mutations further clinical studies may need to be performed.7829 Another possible strategy for the treatment of uncommon EGFR mutations is the combination of EGFR-TKIs and cytotoxic agents. Our group has undertaken a randomized phase 3 trial to compare gefitinib plus carboplatin plus pemetrexed with gefitinib monotherapy for patients with NSCLC with an exon 19 deletion or an L858R G719X or L861Q EGFR mutation (NEJ009; University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trials Registry UMIN-CTR number UMIN000006340). The data from this study will advance the treatment of NSCLC with uncommon EGFR mutations. In our post-hoc analysis clearly demonstrated shorter survival of TKI-treated patients with uncommon EGFR mutations compared with survival of those with common EGFR mutations. Furthermore the data suggest that the first-line chemotherapy may be relatively effective for NSCLC with uncommon EGFR mutations.

{"system": "You are a medical text classifier. Choose exactly one label.", "user": "Text: Clinics will be randomised to have the gene-based test for estimation of lung cancer risk or to act as controls groups. The primary endpoint will be smoking cessation at eight weeks and six months. Secondary outcomes will include ranking of the gene-based test with other smoking cessation motivators. Discussion The results will inform as to whether the gene-based test is both effective as motivator and acceptable to subjects recruited from primary care. Trial registration Registered with Clinical Trials.gov Registration number: NCT01176383. Smoking cessation Genetic test Lung cancer Background Gene testing in primary care is no longer limited by their exorbitant cost. The prices of genetic tests are dropping faster than Moore s law for computing costs 1 . This leads the focus to shift from cost of genetic testing to the clinical value of individual gene tests. The recent development of gene-based tests that predicts the risk of lung cancer in smokers is an important example 2 . Despite the well accepted 10-15 probability of lung cancer in smokers 50 of smokers do not believe they are at significantly increased risk 3 . However over 80 of smokers would like to know their personal risk of lung cancer 4 . There is a plausible three way link between biomarkers for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) a set of 20 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with cancer risk and lung cancer 5-8 (). Research has shown a strong association between a high lung cancer susceptibility score derived from family history of cancer the 20 SNPs COPD history (Auckland formula) and the development of lung cancers whereas healthy smokers matched for age gender and lifetime smoking habits had a relatively low score (n? ?446 lung cancer subjects 484 healthy current smokers). The odds ratio for lung cancer risk varied from 0.2-3.2 depending on the genetic risk (p? ?0.001) 910 . The accuracy of the Auckland formula in estimating lung cancer risk for a score of 4 was: sensitivity 90 specificity 45 ( which also includes scores for 52 subjects who developed cancer from a six year prospective study of 1212 smokers and ex-smokers). The score for prediction of non-cancer was conducted with a follow up of just six years. It means that 45 of non-cancer subjects have a low cancer score and 55 have some degree of increased score. The 55 with increased scores have simply not been followed up long enough for lung cancers to develop yet. Notwithstanding this limitation there is now a 20 SNP gene test for prediction of lung cancer in smokers under the trade name Respiragene. Research that established the respiragene test. Distribution of the Respiragene score in a cross-sectional study of 484 control smokers (blue) and 446 with lung cancer (red) (Total? ?930) and from the prospective study of 52 lung cancer cases (green). Reference 8 . Two case-control studies showed a 5-10 increase in cessation with a single gene test of small effect 1112 . A small smoking cessation pilot study using spirometry results and explanations using the Fletcher-Peto diagram to explain risk demonstrated that patients find this is an acceptable method and the quit rate at 12 months was 27 13 . In a randomised control trial patients were given either a full explanation of the results of spirometry testing including an estimation of lung age or just their forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) without explanation (control group). The group of patients who were given the full explanation had a 7.2 higher quit rate than the control group 14 . Data from a hospital outpatient cohort in Auckland suggest a larger increase in quit rate with Respiragene test and the Auckland formula (). Subjects who were current smokers in the pre-contemplative and contemplative stage were randomised into either the test group or control group and only the test group had the Respiragene test. Counselling and follow-up was done by telephone. Using Auckland formula to incorporate the results of the Respiragene test clinical data and family history a score ranging 1-12 with associated risk level (moderate risk high risk very high risk) was calculated and explained to test subjects. Neither group were involved in any formal smoking cessation programme. Indeed of the 13 subjects that had managed to stop smoking (28 of the gene-tested group) 48 quit without any medical assistance and only 52 had nicotine replacement therapy 1516 . When compared with previous studies using telephone counselling alone 17 () there is a 20-25 improvement in smoking cessation with the Respiragene test (). The improvement in intention to quit increases from 56 before testing to 67 in smokers with an average smokers risk of lung cancer or 89 in smokers with a high risk of lung cancer 18 . Respiragene study in Auckland NZ (n? ?43) Cancer susceptibility scale (compared with normal lifetime risk) Cancer susceptibility score Estimated lifetime risk of lung cancer Initial intention to quit Proportion that stopped smoking at 2-4 weeks Proportion still not smoking at 6 months Expected result for telephone counselling () - - 15 41 10-20 9-12 Telephone counselling? ?Respiragene test 1-2.3 (10-35 risk) 2.3-6.7 (35-65 risk) 6.7-8 (65 -80 risk) 27 had average risk score 15 67 8 27 (30 ) 8 (30 ) 16 had high or very high risk score 30-50 (4-10 times average risk) 89 10 16 (63 ) 6 (37.5 ) Smoking cessation after Respiragene testing and estimation of lung cancer risk with telephone counselling in a small pilot study in Auckland NZ (n? ?43) compared with expected quit rate. Efficacy of the variety of smoking cessation strategies. Percent increase of success for six months over unaided attempts for each type of quitting (chart from West Shiffman based on Cochrane review data). Totally unaided smoking cessation has a 3-6 success rate. Therefore telephone support () increases success rate by 6 9-12 quit rate. A large hospital trial using Respiragene for calculating lung cancer susceptibility is currently underway in the USA 19 but there are no planned UK investigations. This study fills that gap and uses the NHS framework for smoking cessation. Other studies have taken place looking at how lung functioning testing in COPD might motivate smokers to quit suggesting that it is feasible to conduct this sort of study 131420 . This protocol describes a trial to evaluate a gene-based risk test (using genetic and clinical data) as a smoking cessation motivator in smokers wishing to participate in an NHS primary care smoking cessation clinic (in the action stage of change) alongside the usual counselling and prescribing protocol. It will differ from previous studies using gene testing as a motivator however in that the NHS primary care counselling and prescribing protocol will include several other motivators (CO breath testing saliva cotinine testing and intensive counselling) whereas the Auckland trial using the same gene test had none of these. Also the method of recruitment will differ in that primary care subjects will of necessity be different from the Auckland hospital outpatient cohort 1516 . Research question Can the Respiragene test combined with an estimation of lung cancer susceptibility be used to increase the uptake adherence to and success rate in an established smoking cessation programme in subjects who want to quit in a National Health Service United Kingdom (NHS UK) setting? Hypothesis Genetic testing and estimation of lung cancer susceptibility should increase smoking cessation outcomes at six months to 30 (or 1.5-2 fold greater than usual care) irrespective of the risk scores assigned to subjects 11 . Method Design This protocol has been approved by Surrey Research Ethics Committee at the Royal Surrey County Hospital Guildford Surrey UK. 1 Recruitment Focus groups A number of focus groups of different aged smokers will be held to enable them to contribute to the design of the study 2 Recruitment Subjects will be recruited from a large general practice in Surrey (practice population ? ?30000). Smokers aged 20-70 years will be identified from the practice records and contacted by post by their GP. Patients who reply stating that they wish to stop smoking will be randomised (stratified randomisation to ensure equivalent age and gender mix) to two clinics (Figure 3) only one of which will include the gene-based test. Previous trials of genetic testing in association with smoking cessation achieved 83-100 of participants opting for the test depending on the method of recruitment 821 . There will be two mailings with SAEs for recruitment with the aim of recruiting at least 30 subjects per clinic (see Power calculations under heading statistics ). In the first letter the patient s GP asks the patient to give permission for the researcher to contact him her to ask about taking part in smoking cessation research (with possible genetic risk testing) and encloses fact sheet 1 and a stamped addressed envelope (SAE) for reply. Figure 3 Consort 2010 flow diagram for GeTTS recruitment. Mailing 2. The principal investigator mails patient with Letter 2 to ask him her if they would like to attend an 8-week smoking cessation clinic and asks if they would be willing to have a test for genetic susceptibility to development of lung cancer and encloses SAE for reply. Mailing 3. The principal investigator mails Group B subjects and Group A test-concordant subjects to confirm dates of the smoking cessation sessions and full patient information leaflet and consent form enclosed. The information sheet will be slightly different for group A and B. Non-test concordant subjects within group A will be invited to attend the practice nurse for smoking cessation. 3 Inclusion and exclusion criteria i. Inclusion criteria: Aged 20-70 years smoking more than 10 cigarettes daily. ii. Exclusion criteria: Aged under 20 years or over 70 years smoking less than 10 cigarettes daily history of major depression and other psychiatric conditions dementias and serious or terminal illness (cancers etc.). Patients on warfarin would be excluded due to interactions between warfarin and varenicline as varenicline will be used as the modern treatment of choice for smoking cessation. Patients who smoke less than 10 cigarettes day and patients who did not wish to have a genetic test or do not wish to take part in a research study will be referred to the practice nurse for smoking cessation. 4 Smoking cessation clinics For group A subjects only subjects who have expressed an interest in having a genetic test and gene-based estimation of susceptibility to lung cancer in mailing 2 will be invited to participate (see referral for decliners above). For group B subjects all subjects willing to participate are invited to do so. Uptake into smoking cessation programme (i.e. proportion of invitees who accept invitation and attend clinic of those mailed invitation) will be recorded. All subjects who attend the first session of the research clinic will be asked by the principal investigator JN to sign a consent form and will be invited to raise any concerns about the protocol (as explained in the full information sheet). The consent form will then be countersigned by JN. Group A clinics and Group B clinics will be held on different weekdays at the same health centre premises. Test Subjects who attend Clinic A will be offered a fact sheet on the health risks of smoking (including lung cancer) and the option of the gene-based test for calculation of lung cancer susceptibility whilst subjects who attend Clinic B will be given the same fact sheet on the health risks of smoking (including lung cancer) but without any reference to the gene-based test. The principal investigator will be responsible for handing out the fact sheets and administering the gene-based test in Clinic A and for handing out and explaining the fact sheet in Clinic B. NHS Surrey s Smoking Cessation Practitioners will lead in-house smoking cessation clinics A and B using the NHS smoking cessation guidelines 22 under the supervision of the principal investigator at the medical centre. There will be: Introductory session which includes a new near patient test for salivary cotinine (nicotine metabolite) trade name SmokeScreen 23 . At session 2 patients will be given advice on therapies for smoking cessation. We expect that most patients will opt for a course of varenicline and they will be advised to contact their GP for a prescription. This is followed by seven more weekly sessions and a follow-up session at six months (Figure 4). Uptake and adherence to smoking cessation will be monitored by weekly carbon monoxide exhalation measurements (breath test). The principal investigator will be involved in clinic A administering the gene-based test and determining if subjects have COPD from practice records and history in session 1. Participants who are heavy smokers have a smokers cough and use a salbutamol inhaler can be judged to have COPD even if this is not entered in their GP records (all Group A B subjects will have spirometry at their 6-month follow-up). Subsequently the principal investigator will report back to clinic A patients with estimated lung cancer risks (session 3). To ensure balance in the control clinic the principal investigator will also attend Clinic B sessions 2 and 3 (see Figure 5 flow charts). At the eight week clinic and the 6-month follow-up clinic smoking cessation status and carbon monoxide breath test score will be recorded and a feedback questionnaire used to assess efficacy of various components will be administered. Mailing 4. Telephone calls followed by letters to patients with invitation to 6-month follow-up session with NHS Smoking Cessation Practitioners and the principal investigator when cessation rate will be assessed and verified by repeating the carbon monoxide breath and salivary cotinine tests. for further details see Figure 5: flow charts Figure 4 Timeline of project. Figure 5 Flow chart for the duration of the trial. a. Flow chart of project from start to week 12. b. Flow chart of project to week 36. We anticipate good attendance at the eight week free smoking cessation clinic as would be expected if it were a regular NHS smoking cessation clinic but the attendance at the 6-month follow-up clinic may be more challenging. We consider this attendance essential and as attendance will take up an evening of their time study participants should be paid for their travel expenses ( 20) and will receive up to three reminders. Group B subjects attending at the 6-month follow up who have been unable to quit will be offered the gene-based test at this stage. Technique for taking the respiragene test The test requires a Buccal swab and the subjects should not eat or drink within 15 minutes prior to supplying a sample (if has eaten or taken a drink within 15 minutes then rinse mouth with tap water). The nurse taking the sample should wear latex or plastic gloves and take care to avoid contact with the buccal swab collection tip to avoid DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) contamination. Then: 1. Open buccal swab package at the handle end and carefully remove the swab. 2. Holding handle end of swab stick scrape the collection tip firmly against the inside of the cheek 5-6 times (about 10 seconds) being careful not to press the plunger that ejects the tip. 3. After taking the sample eject the swab tip into a labelled 2 ml microcentrifuge tube by firmly pressing the plunger at the end of the handle. 4. Complete and affix the sample tube label onto the microtube. The sample label requires the anonymised trial code for the subject. Storage of the respiragene test After sample collection tips can be kept at room temperature if they are posted immediately. If storage is necessary freeze the tubes containing the tips at -20 C. Packaging instructions for return of samples to Lab21 Ltd 1. Place absorbent material around the tube and then place tube in the plastic bag provided with the kit. Seal the plastic back as per the instructions on the bag 2. Place the plastic bag containing the sample tube into the shipping box. 3. Seal the box with the security seal supplied. 4. Using the Freepost service provided send the samples to: Lab 21 184 Cambridge Science Park Cambridge CB4 0GA. Patients will be asked to sign a disclaimer form that explains clearly that this test can only give an estimation of cancer risk and is a test that is still under development (one copy of form for investigators and one for patient). Interpretation of result of respiragene test Lung cancer susceptibility is calculated using the Respiragene test Auckland formula 7 : Lung cancer score? ?(number of susceptible genotypes) - (number of protective genotypes)? ?3 (for positive family history)? ?4 (for past history of COPD)? ?4 (for age? ?60 years old). The laboratory reports include the scores with an explanation of how the scores relate to a risk category (see ). When the subject is aged 60 years the report will also include the score and risk category that would apply if the subject is still a smoker at age 60 years or over. Follow-up questionnaires The questionnaires will be slightly different for groups A (questionnaire 2a) and B (questionnaire 2b) as only 2a will contain a direct reference to the gene-based test. Patients who fail to attend at eight weeks and six months will be contacted by telephone to remind them to complete their questionnaires and hand them in to the practice manager. They are designed to determine which subjects have quit smoking or cut down and which subjects who have failed to quit still plan to do so. There is a section that asks about general motivators and components of the smoking cessation programme. The subjects will be asked to score these motivators and smoking cessation aids for their efficacy in helping them to quit. The questions in this section are almost identical to a validated questionnaire 24 . There are also further questions on whether the subject would recommend the Respiragene test to a relative or friend and an open ended question for subjects to add their own comments about the concept of a test that predicts susceptibility to lung cancer in a smoker. Data quality assurance The study has been designed and will be reported in accordance with CONSORT (Consolidated Statement of Reporting Trials) 25 . Data will be controlled in accordance with data protection legislation institutional protocols of Sussex NHS Research Consortium and NHS policies for research and information governance for ensuring patient confidentiality 26 . Data will be analysed in SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) version 15 using an intention to treat approach. Outcome measures Primary endpoint Comparison of smoking cessation rates (7 day point abstinence and continuous abstinence) in Clinic A and Clinic B at 8 weeks and six months. Secondary endpoints A. Personal data: 1. Number of smokers still smoking who state that they still plan to stop. 2. Daily cigarette consumption of those still smoking. 3. Mean scores for ranking of smoking cessation aids (gene-based test - Clinic A only salivary cotinine lung cancer facts - controls in Clinic B only and general counselling from NHS smoking counsellors). B. Analyse questions about whether subjects would recommend the test to a member of family or a friend. C. Analyse last (open ended) question using qualitative research methodology. Statistics Primary end point The difference between smoking cessation between Clinic A and Clinic B will be estimated from the four week and six month follow up for the primary endpoint (smoking status confirmed by carbon monoxide breathalyser and salivary cotinine tests). If there is the expected higher rate of smoking cessation for Clinic A compared with Clinic B statistical significance will be demonstrated by the ?2 test. Since there are as yet no case-control studies that compare quit rate following the gene-based test versus quit rate without the test the expected difference in quit rate between Clinic A and Clinic B is difficult to estimate. Two case-control studies showing only a 5-10 increase in smoking cessation involved just a single gene of small effect 1112 . In a randomised control trial patients were given either a full explanation of the results of spirometry testing including an estimation of lung age or just the FEV1 without explanation (control group). The group of patients who were given the full explanation had a 7.2 higher quit rate than the control group. However data from Auckland suggest a larger uplift of quit rate with Respiragene. This can be explained by the superior predictive power of a 20-gene test combined with clinical history (personal history of COPD and family history of lung cancer) to give a rather more impressive estimate of cancer risk than anything previously available. The adequacy of sample size was tested using data from smoking cessation trials that showed: 30-40 smoking cessation at 6-months with similar protocols 2728 . A 48 quit rate at 2-4 weeks in subjects with high and very high lung cancer risk scores but this difference shrinks to 27 at 6 months. Data from Young et al 1518 (independently verified by McBride et al 11 ) that even being given an average score for lung cancer susceptibility increases smoking cessation by approximately 10 . Therefore with a minimum sample sizes of 30 per group the following calculations based on these estimated quit rates apply (Table 2). Statistical power of 87.1 is generally acceptable for publication (for alpha error of 5 - i.e. 5 probability of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis that there is no difference in the percentage values). For further detailed statistical analysis refer to Additional file 1.

Secondary outcome measures Similarly the significance of secondary endpoints on intention to stop smoking cigarette consumption uptake of invitation to cessation adherence to cessation course and self-reported smoking cessation will be calculated by the ?2 test but the p value for the ranking scores for information on lung cancer risk and other smoking cessation aids and motivators will be estimated from the unpaired student t-test. The open ended question: How do you feel now about having had a genetic test that estimates the probability that you will develop lung cancer at some future date? will have to be analysed by qualitative analysis to determine the main recurrent themes in responses. Discussion Overview Smoking cessation is one of the most cost effective interventions that can be achieved in primary care 29 . However many smokers are very reluctant to commit to a smoking cessation programme (precontemplative and contemplative) and about half of those that attend for smoking cessation intervention (action stage of change) are likely to drop out or give up trying. Therefore any methodology that increases motivation in both unmotivated and motivated smokers could be very valuable. The gene-based test we are offering has shown promise as a smoking cessation motivator in precontemplative-contemplative smokers in a hospital outpatient setting 1518 and now needs to be tested out as a motivator for improving adherence in a primary care smoking cessation clinic using a randomised controlled study. Strengths The main strengths of this study are that it is being carried out on subjects from a large primary care population and should therefore be more representative of the general population than previous studies recruited from hospital patients and other special groups. We also have the advantage of being able to carry out this research within the established framework of the local stop smoking service. Limitations and assumptions Although we have estimated based on previous smoking cessation work using this gene-based test that the primary endpoint will show that having the test improves quit rate by 20-25 this was based on a cohort of hospital outpatients in Auckland New Zealand and subjects recruited from primary care may respond differently. Although we plan to recruit a minimum of 60 subjects this may not be enough to balance unexpected and unknown confounding factors. What we might find We aim to recruit a minimum of 60 subjects to randomise 30 into group A (test group) and 30 into Group B (control group). The normal experience in NHS smoking cessation clinics is a drop-out rate of 40-50 30-32 . We need therefore to attempt to recruit about 120 subjects in order to get a statistically significant result based on the assumptions in our power calculations. We may however have underestimated the 6-month quit rate using the NHS local stop smoking guidelines 22 which typically involves a multi-interventional programme which includes combinations of varenicline prescriptions breath carbon monoxide monitoring and intensive counselling giving a quit rate of 70-80 at 6-weeks.There are however no Surrey data for 6-month quit rate which we assume on the basis of similar smoking cessation data to be about half the 6-week figure 33 ? 35 . An unknown and unpredictable factor that could skew results significantly is the possibility that our multi-interventional approach could help to reinforce the health risk message equally for subjects in both groups. Also the Auckland study design involved recruitment of precontemplative-contemplative smokers from a hospital outpatient setting compared to this study that will involve primary care subjects who have volunteered to participate in a smoking cessation programme (ie smokers in the action stage of quitting). This population therefore could be sufficiently different to give unexpected results. However the results of this trial will inform as to the acceptability of this approach as well as its effectiveness.

synechocystis and human dash type cryptochromes crys gene mutantstrains but the fruiting bodies were unable to elongate normally and crydash and cmwc1exhibited interdependent expression under light in c militaris compared to light temperature is another pivotal factor influencing fruiting body formation from a hyphal thallus which represents a transition from simple to complex multicellularity the fruiting body formation of various mushrooms depends on low temperaturecold stress induction for example the fruiting body development was induced by shiftingthe cultivation condition Ë c for mycelia to lower temperature Ë c in flammulina velutipes in pleurotus ostreatus the mycelia were cultured at Ë c for days in a sawdustmedium and then the temperature was lowered to Ë c to induce fruiting body development in c militaris after the mycelia were cultured under static conditions at Ë c on potatodextrose broth medium for days the mycelia were injected into pupae and then the inoculated pupae were kept at Ë c to induce the fruiting bodies however the molecular mechanism of mycelial development to fruiting body under cold induction has been subject tosurprisingly few studies which will seriously restrict the further development of commercialproduction of mushrooms fruiting bodiestwocomponent signal transduction is commonly used by eubacteria archea and eukaryotes as a stimulus response coupling mechanism to sense and respond to changes in many different environmental conditions especially temperature sensing they consist of ahistidine kinase hk and a response regulator the histidine kinase desk from bacillus subtilis is mechanistically the best understood after a temperature downshift desk gets autophosphorylated at the conserved histidine residue and donates the phosphate group to theconserved aspartate residue of desr the phosphorylated desr activates the transcription ofthe des gene however little is known the role of hk genes in cold stress response

important tool to understand the complex signaling networks when an anism is submitted to different stimuli however the resultsof qrtpcr are often inaccurate because of the occurrence of errors in the

ensure the accuracy of qrtpcr results it is necessary to analyze the stability ofinternal rg under a specific experimental condition a previous study in c militaris showedthat polymerase ii large

the expressionstability of candidate rgs in c militaris was systematically analyzed by genorm normfinder and bestkeeper under the cold treatment our results showed that ubc and ubq wereidentified as the most suitable for qrtpcr normalization under cold incubation during shortand long cold periods respectively while the act a traditionally rg was not suitable coldstress in c militaris therefore we suggest to use two or more rgs rpb1 ubc and ubq tostudy the expression levels of the fruiting body developmental genes in c militaris in the followup studya large number of studies have been conducted to identify the suitable rgs under coldtreatment conditions among different species but the most stable rgs are diverse table inpineapple ananas comosus l pp2a and cyp were the stable rgs under cold

the more interesting result is that in our study ubc was thestable rg in short periods but not the stable rg in long periods all of these results indicatethat the expression stability of the same gene

national preproof 0c knowledge infrastructure database national intellectual property administration prc national medical products administration and those published resources msc thesis and books results a total of compounds have been identified in herba patriniae including triterpenoid saponins flavonoids anic acids irids and volatiles a very distinct difference was observed that ps is rich in triterpenoid saponins and volatiles while pv contains more flavonoids two source species of herba patriniae gave similar pharmacological effects on anticancer antiinflammatory antioxidant antimicrobial sedative and hypnotic effects but there were no reports were on antipruritic proangiogenic and antidiarrheal effects for ps and no studies on antidiabetic effects for pv generally herba patriniae showed nontoxic in the clinical dose but mild side effects such as temporary leukopenia dizziness and nausea could be found when large and excessive dosage is used a variety of compounds have been quantified for the quality control of ps and pv the variety growth environment growth time and harvest time not only affected the contents but also the pharmacological activities of the bioactive compounds in the past year patents for compositions containing pv and ps have been filed mainly involving human health hygiene agriculture and animal husbandry unfortunately the research on pharmacokinetics is insufficient only the prototype components and metabolites were repored after intragastric administration of total flavonoids extract from pv in rats herba patriniae has displayed a significant medicinal value in clinic but the differences in phytochemistry pharmacological effects and the content of compounds have been found between two official recorded species about side effects and pharmacokinetic characteristics the differeces between two species have not been well studied for a better clinical use of herba patriniae it is urgent to establish systematic pharmacology

effects of herba patriniae interestingly based on these studies we found that there are many differentsame characteristics between ps and pv both of them are official species for herba patriniae but differentiated clinical uses of them in different diseases may be better for the clinical outcome unfortunately we cannot found a comprehensive and updated review on the samedifferent characteristics of the two sources of herba patriniae and actually these two species also have not been differentiated in clinical uses therefore this review aims to systematically summarize the similarities and differences from the preproof 0c aspects of the traditional uses botanical description phytochemistry pharmacology and quality control of these two species of herba patriniae as well as being

Choose exactly one label.", "user": "Text: Log-rank test determined that the PFS and OS in high KLK11 group were significantly longer than those in the low KLK11 group (P? ?0.003; P? ?0.018) Discussion During the last few years numerous studies have been published which attempt to refine our understanding of determinants of prognosis in lung cancer by analyzing tumor-associated markers thought to be of biologic relevance in the carcinogenic process. Proteolytic enzymes of several catalytic classes have emerged as important prognostic factors in cancer 12 . Among these enzymes are many members of human tissue kallikrein family of secreted serine proteases including KLK11 a promising biomarker for lung cancer diagnosis and prognosis 1113 . In the present study serum KLK11 levels were significantly elevated in patients with lung cancer compared with control subjects making them potential adjunctive tools for diagnosis of lung cancer. Furthermore at a cutoff point of 1.05 ng ml KLK11 had a sensitivity of 91.3 and a specificity of 72.5 for the prediction of lung cancer. Importantly the serum KLK11 levels did not differ significantly with age gender and histology. The levels of KLK11 were significantly correlated with TNM stage the presence of lymph node and distant metastases. Several previous studies have reported an association between kallikrein mRNA expression and cancer prognosis 14 16 . KLK5 and KLK4 have been associated with poor prognosis in ovarian cancer and KLK5 has also been shown to be associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer 1718 . In contrast KLK8 and KLK9 expression have been reported to be favorable prognosis in ovarian cancer 1920 . In addition KLK12 is reported to be an independent and favorable prognostic marker for breast cancer 21 . Sasaki et al. 11 have indicated that there is a significant correlation between decreased KLK11 mRNA expression level and poor prognosis in lung cancer. This study supports the increasing body of literature demonstrating the expression of kallikrein family gene involvement in the prognosis of human cancers. The most striking association we observed in NSCLC patients was a significant correlation between increased KLK11 level and favorable prognosis. We have demonstrated that high KLK11 was significantly associated with an increased PFS and OS in univariate analysis. This relationship was further illustrated in the Kaplan Meier survival curves. Multivariate analysis also indicated that KLK11 was an independent indicator of PFS and OS. In our data suggest that serum KLK11 may be a useful diagnostic biomarker and shows a promising potential as prognostic marker in NSCLC patients. More large-scale prospective studies are warranted to confirm the findings. Conflicts of interest None. References 1.

Previous studies reported overexpression of HEDGEHOG (HH)-GLI signaling components in LSCC. However they addressed neither the tumor heterogeneity nor the requirement for HH-GLI signaling. Here we investigated the role of HH-GLI signaling in LSCC and studied the therapeutic potential of HH-GLI suppression. Experimental Design Gene expression datasets of two independent LSCC patient cohorts were analyzed to study the activation of HH-GLI signaling. Four human LSCC cell lines were examined for HH-GLI signaling components. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were assayed in these cells after blocking the HH-GLI pathway by lentiviral-shRNA knockdown or small molecule inhibitors. Xenografts in immunodeficient mice were used to determine the in vivo efficacy of GLI inhibitor GANT61. Results In both cohorts activation of HH-GLI signaling was significantly associated with the classical subtype of LSCC. In cell lines genetic knockdown of SMO produced minor effects on cell survival while GLI2 knockdown significantly reduced proliferation and induced extensive apoptosis. Consistently the SMO inhibitor GDC-0449 resulted in limited cytotoxicity in LSCC cells whereas the GLI inhibitor GANT61 was very effective. Importantly GANT61 demonstrated specific in vivo anti-tumor activity in xenograft models of GLI-positive cell lines. Conclusion Our studies demonstrate an important role for GLI2 in LSCC and suggest GLI inhibition as a novel and potent strategy to treat a subset of LSCC patients.

Preoperative localization is necessary prior to video assisted thoracoscopic surgery for the detection of small or deeply located lung nodules. We compared the localization ability of a mixture of lipiodol and methylene blue (MLM) (0.6 mL 1:5) to methylene blue (0.5 mL) in rabbit lungs. CT-guided percutaneous injections were performed in 21 subjects with MLM and methylene blue. We measured the extent of staining on freshly excised lung and evaluated the subjective localization ability with 4 point scales at 6 and 24 hr after injections. For MLM radio-opacity was evaluated on the fluoroscopy. We considered score 2 (acceptable) or 3 (excellent) as appropriate for localization. The staining extent of MLM was significantly smaller than methylene blue (0.6 vs 1.0 cm P 0.001). MLM showed superior staining ability over methylene blue (2.8 vs 2.2 P 0.010). Excellent staining was achieved in 17 subjects (81 ) with MLM and 8 (38 ) with methylene blue (P 0.011). An acceptable or excellent radio-opacity of MLM was found in 13 subjects (62 ). An appropriate localization rate of MLM was 100 with the use of the directly visible ability and radio-opacity of MLM. MLM provides a superior pulmonary localization ability over methylene blue.

However uncertainty exists in proton-based treatment plans including range uncertainties large sensitivity to position uncertainty and calculation of dose deposition in heterogeneous areas. This study investigated the feasibility of proton transmission beams i.e. without the Bragg peak to treat lung tumors with stereotactic ablative radiotherapy. We compared three representative treatment plans using proton transmission beams versus conformal static-gantry photon beams. It was found that proton treatment plans using transmission beams passing through the patient were feasible and demonstrated lower dose to normal structures and markedly reduced treatment times than photon plans. This is the first study to demonstrate the feasibility of proton-based stereotactic ablative radiotherapy planning for lung tumors using proton transmission beams alone. Further research using this novel approach for proton-based planning is warranted. The authors have no support or funding to report. Introduction Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) plays an essential role in the treatment of patients with medically inoperable early stage lung cancer and oligometastasis. The use of protons for lung SABR is emerging as an appealing treatment option because of its potential to deliver higher doses of conformal radiotherapy and spare normal tissues better than traditional photons 1 2 3 4 . This can be achieved because of the natural characteristics of proton beams that deposit its dose at depth with no exit dose referred to as a Bragg peak. However conventional dosimetric models fail to accurately model how protons scatter and deposit dose in highly heterogeneous areas which leads to uncertainties in proton treatment plans 5 . In addition the uncertainties in the stopping power of the various tissues in the body and the interplay effect between spot scanning proton therapy and the target motion leads to large uncertainties in the treatment of lung tumors 5 6 . In this study we report on the feasibility of proton transmission-beam SABR (PT-SABR) for lung tumors which uses the transmission portion of a spot scanning proton beam i.e. without the Bragg peak. This technique eliminates the major uncertainties of proton therapy mentioned above by having the proton beams pass through the patient. In addition the use of the transmission beam allows an entire field to be treated in one breath hold. This quick treatment and decreased uncertainties lead to smaller planning volumes. To the best of the authors knowledge this is the first report on the use of this novel approach to plan SABR with protons without using the Bragg peak which may have dosimetric advantages over photon treatments. Materials and Methods Ethics Statement Written informed consent was obtained from all patients registered in the SABR database. This study including the consent procedure was approved by the Mayo Clinic institutional review board. Patient Cohort Patients were identified from a prospectively collected institutional database of patients treated with SABR. Patients with lung tumors less than one centimetre in maximum dimension were included. The radiation treatment plans of three patients were extracted from the treatment planning system. All patients were treated using three-dimensional conformal multiple static-gantry photon beams. Plans were normalized so that 95 of the planning target volume (PTV) received at least 95 of the prescription dose. The prescription doses for these plans were adjusted to 34 Gy in one fraction based on the recently reported results of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 0915 which established this dose fractionation regimen as a possible standard dose to be used in future trials 7 . Dose calculations for photon plans used the anisotropic analytical algorithm. Proton Treatment Planning A machine was commissioned in Eclipse v.10 (Varian Medical Systems Palo Alto CA) which allowed for planning and calculating transmission dose plans. The spot size (sigma) of the transmission beam which had an energy of 229 MeV was 2.2 mm. A proton plan that only used the transmission portion of the beam was created for each patient. Proton beam arrangements were selected so that no beams entered through the heart or spinal cord and allowed up to two non-coplanar beams. Four to five beams were used to keep the skin dose comparable to photon plans. The energy of the protons for each spot of a field was 229 MeV; this ensured the Bragg peak was not located within the patient. Dose calculations for the transmission portion of the proton beam were verified with Monte Carlo (Geant4). The proton plans were normalized so that the internal target volume (ITV) receives at least 95 of prescription dose including when range and position errors were included (3.5 and 2 mm) which is standard for spot scanning proton therapy. ITVs were created based on motion of the gross tumor volume in three dimensions using four-dimensional computed tomography image data. The dose constraints from RTOG 0915 were compared for the photon and proton plans as well as the total time that would be required to deliver the treatment. The radiotherapy delivery time per beam was estimated at 1 nC per second for proton therapy which is readily achievable by most spot scanning proton centers and 600 MU per minute for the photon plans. Differences in dosimetric and treatment planning parameters between photon and proton plans were analyzed with two-sided paired t-tests using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc. Cary NC). Results The ITVs of the three tumors measured 0.220.42 and 0.99 cubic centimeters. All three proton plans had excellent coverage of the ITV. For all ITVs over 99.4 of the volume received at least 95 of the prescription dose including when uncertainties were examined. This was comparable with the photon plans where 100 of the ITVs received at least 95 of the prescription dose. For most normal tissues lower doses to these ans were achieved with the proton plans compared to the photon plans ().

The average number of monitor units per field was 818 (range 758 871) with photons and only 38 (range 31 59) with protons. This would translate to an average beam-on time per field of 82 seconds versus 6 seconds for photon and proton plans respectively.

PT-SABR planning requires fewer beams than photons and careful selection of optimal beam angles allows for minimal dose to adjacent normal tissues and tumor dose escalation which may translate to improved local control rates. RTOG 0915 showed that 34 Gy in a single fraction was comparable to 48 Gy in four fractions 7 and the dosimetric constraints from the protocol were easily achieved using both proton and photon plans for patients in this study. Further optimization with proton therapy can allow even higher doses to be delivered while still respecting established dosimetric constraints for normal tissues. This may translate to better tumor control but requires more investigation in a clinical setting. Patients planned with PT-SABR required fewer beams (5 vs. 10) which reduce the total treatment time and the low dose outside the tumor. The average monitor units per field for PT-SABR plans were a fraction of those needed for the photon plans (). This translates to a beam on time per field of between 5 and 10 seconds for the PT-SABR plans compared to 75 to 90 seconds for photon plan. This 5 to 10 second time estimate is based on a conservative 1 nC sec dose rate however new proton centers may be able to achieve greater than 2 nC sec thereby reducing this time by a factor of 2. By decreasing the treatment time to less than 10 seconds per field breath-hold techniques may be better tolerated in greater number of lung cancer patients with suboptimal lung function. Breath-hold technique would minimize tumor motion (i.e. ITV) leading to a smaller overall irradiation volume and interplay would not be a significant issue 8 . Spot scanning proton therapy that utilizes the Bragg peak would require a larger planning volume due to the various uncertainties that need to be taken into account; and it would require a longer treatment time due to the use of multiple proton energies. Each change in energy requires several seconds (2 to 7) and at least 5 to 10 energies would be required for these treatments. Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) with photons may decrease treatment times compared to multiple static-gantry beams. However VMAT comes at the cost of larger volumes of normal tissue receiving low doses of radiation since the beam is continuously on as it rotates about the patient. The use of four to five proton transmission beams achieves both shorter treatment times as well as a lower integral dose to the body. The dosimetric data of the normal tissues in the photons plans met the constraints of RTOG 0915. The dosimetric gains of protons over these plans may be considered modest and the statistical analysis comparing plans is limited by the small sample size. However in some plans the dose to particular critical ans can be avoided completely without compromising target coverage by choosing beam arrangements appropriately. This may be beneficial in treating patients with tumors in challenging locations 9 or recurrent tumors that have had prior radiotherapy. The interim analysis of RTOG 0617 reported local failure rates of 25 and 34 in the standard and high dose RT arms 10 and therefore re-irradiation may play a role in this subset of patients who fail after definitive chemoradiotherapy. For these patients keeping dose at or near zero to the spinal cord heart lungs or other critical structures is feasible with protons. Planning with PT-SABR using only transmission beams without the Bragg peak is feasible. This proof of principle as described in our study eliminates the uncertainty of proton dose distribution in lung tumors which has the potential to underdose the target and overdose surrounding normal tissues. Proton therapy planning with this technique also demonstrates better sparing of normal tissues and fast treatment times than photon plans.

BACKGROUND This cooperative group adjuvant phase 2 trial in patients with completely resected stage I non-small cell lung cancer with tumor diameters measuring ??2 cm was designed to assess the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of assigning patients to therapy or observation using a molecularly based decision algorithm. METHODS At least a lobectomy and sampling of recommended mediastinal lymph node stations good Zubrod performance status adequate an function and a formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tumor specimen were required. Excision repair cross-complementing group 1 (ERCC1) and ribonucleotide reductase M1 (RRM1) were analyzed using immunofluorescence-based in situ automated quantitative image analysis and categorized as high or low using prespecified cutoff values. Patients with high ERCC1 and RRM1 were assigned to observation and all others to 4 cycles of cisplatin and gemcitabine. Feasibility was defined as treatment assignment within 84 days from surgery in ?85 of patients. Secondary objectives were to estimate the 2-year survival. RESULTS Treatment assignment met the feasibility criteria in 88 of eligible patients (71 of 81 patients). The collective 2-year disease-free and overall survival rates were 80 and 96 respectively. Protein levels for RRM1 fell within the previously established range ERCC1 levels were slightly lower than expected and they were significantly correlated (correlation coefficient 0.4). The rates of assignment of patients to observation (22 ) and chemotherapy (78 ) were as expected. CONCLUSIONS Gene expression analysis for treatment assignment is feasible. Survival results are encouraging and require future validation. Real-time performance of quantitative in situ ERCC1 and RRM1 analysis requires further development. lung cancer adjuvant therapy personalized medicine ERCC1 (excision repair cross-complementing group 1) RRM1 (ribonucleotide reductase M1) INTRODUCTION After publication of the International Adjuvant Lung Cancer Trial in 2004 adjuvant chemotherapy containing a platinum agent has become the standard of care for patients with a complete surgical resection of American Joint Committee on Cancer stage II to III (version 6) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).1 The trial included patients with stage I to III disease and demonstrated an absolute 4.1 improvement in overall survival (OS) and a subgroup analysis indicated that the OS benefit increased with stage: the hazards ratio (HR) for death among patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy compared with controls was approximately 0.98 for patients with stage I disease 0.88 for patients with stage II disease and 0.79 for patients with stage III disease.1 The data were confirmed by the National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group JBR.10 trial in 2005 which included patients with stage IB and stage II disease.2 A third trial Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 9633 which included only patients with stage IB disease was terminated early and also reported a therapeutic benefit for adjuvant chemotherapy.3 However a final analysis of mature data revealed no statistically significant OS benefit (HR 0.83) but demonstrated a benefit for patients with tumor diameters of ??4 cm (HR 0.69).4 During the same time period an increasing number of correlative biomarker analyses demonstrated that the efficacy of platinum agents was associated with intratumoral levels of the excision repair cross-complementing group 1 (ERCC1) gene with high levels indicating resistance.5 9 Similarly high intratumoral levels of the regulatory subunit of ribonucleotide reductase M1 (RRM1) were reported to be predictive of resistance to gemcitabine.9 13 Finally both biomarkers had also been reported to be prognostic of survival in patients who had not received chemotherapy or radiation with high levels indicating longer survival.814 16 Based on these data we designed an adjuvant trial in 2007. The underlying hypothesis was that patients with high intratumoral levels of ERCC1 and RRM1 would not benefit from chemotherapy and would have a good prognosis because of a less aggressive tumor phenotype. In contrast patients with low levels of ERCC1 and RRM1 would have tumors that were sensitive to chemotherapy but with a more aggressive phenotype. Because a biomarker-driven adjuvant chemotherapy selection trial had not been performed in patients with NSCLC we focused on demonstrating the feasibility of such an approach before launching a phase 3 trial. In addition because adjuvant chemotherapy had quickly become the standard of care for patients with stage II IIIA disease we focused our efforts on patients with stage I disease. After discussions within the SWOG (formerly the Southwest Oncology Group) lung cancer working group and the National Cancer Institute (NCI)'s Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program and after peer review by a National Institutes of Health study section the consensus was to focus this feasibility trial on patients with stage I disease and tumor diameters of ?2 cm. MATERIALS AND METHODS Trial Design and Treatment Plan The trial (NCT00792701 SWOG-0720) complied with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the study institutions. Eligibility criteria included a diagnosis of NSCLC; stage I disease (according to version 6 of the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging manual) with a tumor diameter ??2?cm; a complete surgical resection by lobectomy bilobectomy or pneumonectomy; surgical staging of the mediastinum through sampling of at least 2 lymph node stations; a positron emission tomography scan; a computed tomographic scan of the chest and abdomen; adequate bone marrow liver and renal function; a Zubrod performance status of 0 or 1; and willingness to provide a smoking history. Patients with a prior malignancy prior radiation to the chest or other significant illnesses according to good medical practice were excluded. Patients had to be registered on the trial within 35 days of surgery. Tumor specimens were then retrieved and shipped to a central laboratory. They were analyzed for in situ tumor levels of ERCC1 and RRM1 using an immunofluorescence-based automated quantitative analysis method.17 Prespecified cutoff levels that had been determined in 187 patients with stage I disease (??65 for ERCC1 and ??40 for RRM1) were used to categorize specimens as high or low expressors for each marker (Fig. 1).16 The appropriate therapeutic assignment was then passed on to the statistical center and the participating therapeutic center; however specific protein levels were not communicated to the treatment center. Therapeutic assignment was based solely on biomarker categories and no other stratification parameters were used. CONSORT (Consolidated Standards Of Reporting Trials) diagram of the trial is shown. Patients with high levels of both biomarkers received active surveillance and patients with low levels of one or both biomarkers received 4 cycles of cisplatin (at a dose of 80 mg m2 on day 1) and gemcitabine (at a dose of 1 g m2 on days 1 and 8) every 21 days. The protocol included provisions for dose reductions or treatment delays. The addition of other targeted or cytotoxic agents during therapy or as maintenance was not permitted. Specimen Collection Processing and Gene Expression Analysis The study required the collection and shipment of formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tumor blocks before therapy. However if local policies did not permit submission of a tissue block 10 serial unstained sections could be submitted. Processing was done in a reference laboratory by 1 of 2 investigators (V.O. and Z.Z.). Sections measuring 5 ?m in thickness were placed on frosted glass slides and in situ quantification was performed by the automated quantitative analysis method (PM-2000 version 1 HistoRx Inc New Haven CT) as previously described.91618 The primary antibody for the detection of ERCC1 was clone 8F1 (product code NB500-704 lots G412 and H347 from Novus Biologicals Littleton Colo ) and the antiserum for RRM1 was R1AS-6 (generated in a rabbit in 2003 against a keyhole limpet hemocyanin KLH -conjugated 21-aminoacid peptide specific to the N-terminal of RRM1 column purification lot 09-2008). Slides were scanned with SpotGrabber (HistoRx New Haven Conn.) and image data were captured with a digital camera and fluorescence microscope and analyzed. Scores were adjusted to range from 1 to 255. Because full sections were evaluated for each specimen multiple spots with diameters of 0.6 mm were analyzed to obtain a representative level of protein expression. The number of spots was dependent on suitable areas with tumor cells and it ranged from 5 to 25 spots (median 10 spots) for both targets. Runs included a tissue microarray of 15 control specimens in triplicate for control purposes. Statistical Analysis The primary objective of the current study was the feasibility of a biomarker-based treatment assignment in the cooperative group setting. If the true success rate were ??75 then a biomarker-based treatment assignment would not be considered feasible but if the true success rate were ??90 it would be feasible. If ??47 of 55 eligible patients (85 ) were successfully assigned to treatment or active monitoring within 84 days from surgery this would be considered evidence of feasibility. The design had 91 power using an exact binomial test with a 1-sided type I error of 5 . Secondary objectives included estimating the collective 2-year disease-free survival (DFS) for patients who accepted their treatment assignment and in the subset of patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy. However there would be no comparison made between treatment arms. To assess DFS the disease status was monitored every 2 months for the first 6 months and subsequently every 3 months by computed tomography after enrollment and according to good medical practice. Toxicities related to the administration of chemotherapy were assessed according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 3.0; ctep.cancer.gov). DFS was defined as the time from the date of enrollment to disease recurrence or death due to any cause and estimated according to the Kaplan-Meier method. A Cox regression model was fit with the time from surgery to enrollment as a covariate to evaluate its effect on DFS. A natural log transformation was applied to the raw protein measurement data and the Pearson correlation coefficient was used to test associations. Bivariate comparison of baseline characteristics between the assigned treatment groups was performed using the Fisher exact test for categorical variables or the Student t test or Wilcoxon rank sum test for continuous variables. A multivariable logistic model to evaluate baseline factors and treatment assignment was fit using backwards selection. Median ERCC1 and RRM1 expression levels were compared with historical medians using the 1-sample Wilcoxon signed rank test. The percentage of patients with both ERCC1 ??65 and RRM1 ??40 was compared with the historical rate using a chi-square test. All statistical analyses and graphics were performed using SAS statistical software (version 9.2; SAS Institute Inc Cary NC). A significance level of 5 was used for all analyses. RESULTS Patient and Trial Characteristics To ensure an adequate sample size of eligible patients and biomarker-specific subgroups a total of 85 patients was registered between April 2 2009 and April 1 2011 from 27 participating sites. Four patients were ineligible; 3 had inadequate lymph node sampling and 1 did not have a tumor measuring ??2 cm. provides the characteristics of the 81 eligible patients.

invasion of cancer cells into any of the layers of the nerve sheatha higher grade of perineural invasion was related to local recurrence and metastasis in distant ans such as the liver lungand peritoneum all patients in this study underwent radical surgery with lymphnode dissection a minimum of harvested lymph nodes is recommended to ensure adequatestaging and oncologic resection for colorectal cancer themore lymph nodes harvested the better the prognosis in this study the average number of harvested lymph nodeswas we found that patients with 15 harvested lymphnodes had better os and rfs than those with harvestedlymph nodes several studies have shown that elevated preoperative cea was a poor prognostic factor in colorectal cancer in our study we also found that patients with an elevated preoperative cea had poorer os and rfsour study has several limitations first a selection biasexisted due to its retrospective design to reduce this the twogroups were matched carefully using psm second the statistical power is insufficient because the number of patients enrolled may not be sufficient after matching third data aboutadjuvant therapy after surgery were not collected which mightbe different between both groups and thus have influenced survival outcomes fourth the exclusion of converted cases mayintroduce a bias in favor of laparoscopic surgery finally thebowelrecovery data could not be exactly assessed due to thelack of records in this retrospective study therefore further research with a large population is still awaitedanydifferencesinin our

{"system": "You are a medical text classifier. Choose exactly one label.", "user": "Text: CR1 also modulates the complement cascade activation by preventing formation of classical and alternative pathway convertases and by acting as a cofactor for factor I mediated inactivation of C3b and C4b 89 . It has been demonstrated that chronic inflammation can predispose to cancer development and spread 10 as a fundamental component of innate immunity the complement cascade consists of potential proinflammatory molecules especially C3 and C5. Moreover complement activation and abnormal expression in tumor tissues has been demonstrated 11 . Considering the important role of CR1 in complement activation innate immunity and chronic inflammation CR1 has emerged as a molecule of immense interest in gaining insight into the susceptibility to cancer. CR1 gene is located on the Chromosome 1 at the locus 1q32 12 . Various polymorphisms have been studied including the intronic and exonic density polymorphism for their ability to alter the density of erythrocyte CR1 on the cell membranes 13-15 . There are also the molecular weight variants due to insertion-deletion polymorphisms 16 . Up to now there have been very few studies on the association of genetic variants of CR1 with susceptibility to autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. It has been proposed that genetic variant at CR1 gene (rs6656401) might influence the susceptibility to late-onset Alzheimer s disease 17 . CR1 expression in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) may be a new biomarker for prognosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma and a potential therapeutic target 18 . Recently it has been indicated that CR1 A3650G (His1208Arg) polymorphism plays a critical role in conferring genetic susceptibility to gallbladder cancer in north Indian population 19 . However the association of genetic variants of CR1 with risk of lung cancer remains unexplored. Worldwide lung cancer is the most common cancer in terms of both incidence and mortality 20 . NSCLC is the most common subtype of lung cancer and less aggressive and metastic than SCLC. Although cigarette smoking is the predominant risk factor for lung cancer inherited genetic characteristics are presumed to account in part for this interindividual variation in lung cancer susceptibility. Recently several genome-wide association studies have demonstrated the common genetic variations associated with susceptibility to lung cancer 21-24 . Given the involvement of the complement system in coordinating innate immunity and inflammatory response 25 further examination of the potential association between genetic variation of CR1 genes and lung cancer is warranted. In the current study we conducted a case-control study to investigate the association of tag SNPs in CR1 gene with the risk of NSCLC and effect of the interaction of gene-environment on the risk of NSCLC. Results Subject characteristics The frequency distributions of select characteristics in cases and control subjects were shown in . The mean age ( SD) was 59.6? ?10.5 years for the cancer patients and 57.2? ?13.3 years for the controls. No significant difference was found in the mean age between cases and controls (P? ?0.470). There was no significant difference in proportion of sex and smoking status between cases and controls (P? ?0.832 and P? ?0.321 respectively). However there was significant difference between cases and controls when compared by pack-year smoked (P 0.001). The heavy smokers (?25 pack-year) accounted for 61.5 in cases but only 45.5 in controls which suggested that cigarette smoking was a prominent contributor to the risk of lung cancer. Of the 470 case patients 178 (37.9 ) were diagnosed as adenocarcinoma 238 (50.6 ) as squamous cell carcinoma and 100 ( ) as other types including large cell carcinoma (n? ?49) and mixed cell carcinoma (n? ?5).

Association of CR1 tag SNP with NSCLC risk Total 13 selected tag SNPs of CR1 in HapMap database among Chinese population were analyzed. Except for rs9429782 polymorphism the genotype distributions of other SNPs in controls were consistent to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Therefore we excluded the rs9429782 from further analysis. In order to screen the genetic variants that confer the susceptibility to lung cancer 12 candidate tagSNPs were genotyped in a case-control study consisting of 470 lung cancer patients and 470 cancer-free controls as shown in . Importantly genotype frequency of one intronic SNP (rs7525160 G? ?C) in cases was found to be significantly different from those of controls (?2? ?6.339 P 0.042). Further multivariate regression model with adjustment for age gender and smoking status was used to assess the association between rs7525160 G? ?C polymorphism and the risk of NSCLC. The results indicated that the rs7525160 CC genotype was associated with an increased risk of developing NSCLC with OR (95 CI) of 1.52 (1.02-2.28) compared with the GG genotype.

Interaction of CR1 SNP with smoking Cigarette smoking is a well-known risk for lung cancer so stratification by smoking status was performed to investigate the association of rs7525160 G? ?C variant with the risk of NSCLC. As shown in Table 4 the risk of NSCLC was associated with the rs7525160 C allele carriers in smokers with OR (95 CI) of 1.72 (1.15-2.59) but not in non-smokers with OR (95 CI) of 1.15 (0.81-1.65) suggesting that the CR1 rs7525160 G? ?C polymorphism is a smoking-modifying risk factor for susceptibility to NSCLC. When the interaction between smoking status and rs7525160 G? ?C variant was analyzed with cumulative smoking dose (pack-year) consistently GC or CC genotype carriers have increased risk of NSCLC among heavy smokers (pack-year???25) with OR (95 CI) of 2.01 (1.26-3.20) but not among light smokers (pack-year 25) with OR (95 CI) of 1.32 (0.81-2.16). The P value for heterogeneity of the stratification analysis by smoking status is 0.015. However the P value for interaction between rs7525160 polymorphism and smoking is 0.172 and the power for the interaction is 0.49. Discussion The chronic airway inflammation and dysfunctional immune system might promote pulmonary carcinogenesis. Implicated in the immune and inflammatory responses the complement cascade plays a pivotal role in the development of cancer. Thus it is likely that the genetic variants of CR1 in the complement system confer the susceptibility to lung cancer. In this study we have for the first time demonstrated that one intronic SNP (rs7525160 G? ?C) out of 13 tag SNPs of CR1 was associated with the risk of NSCLC in Chinese population. Notably the rs7525160 CC genotype was associated with an increased risk of developing NSCLC (OR? ?1.52 95 CI? ?1.02-2.28; P? ?0.028) compared with the GG genotype. MDR analysis also showed that there was no gene-gene interaction among 12 tag SNPs in CR1 gene. Moreover the risk of NSCLC was associated with the rs7525160 C allele carriers in smokers with OR (95 CI) of 1.72 (1.15-2.59) but not in non-smokers with OR (95 CI) of 1.15 (0.81-1.65) indicating this SNP is a smoking-modifying risk factor for susceptibility to NSCLC. To the best of our knowledge this study shed new insight into the interplay of genetic variation of CR1 with lung cancer risk. More importantly it highlights the potential gene-environmental interaction influences the susceptibility to lung cancer. The complement system has been proposed to get involved in innate immunity with the ability to complement antibody-mediated elimination of immune complex and foreign pathogens 26 . Upon complement activation the biologically active peptides C5a and C3a elicit a lot of pro-inflammatory effects and could be closely associated with tumorigenesis 27 . Complement proteins play a dual role in the tumor microenvironment. On one hand they exert a defensive effect against tumor through complement or antibody-dependent cytotoxicity 128 . On the other hand they may escape from immunosurveillance and facilitate carcinogenesis 2 . Specifically a number of experimental evidence has suggested an association between complement activation and tumor growth 2930 which provides a strong biologically link between the abnormal expression and activity of complement cascade and carcinogenesis. Till now a few studies have been carried out to demonstrate the association of genetic variants in complement proteins with susceptibility to cancer. A significant association of CR2 SNP (rs3813946) with the development of nasopharyngeal carcinoma was indicated in Cantonese population 31 and the genetic variations of complement system genes C5 and C9 plays a potential role in susceptibility to non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) 32 . Recently it has been shown that complement factor H Y402H polymorphism interact with cigarette smoking to confer the susceptibility to lung cancer 33 . Furthermore it has been indicated that CR1 A3650G (His1208Arg) polymorphism plays a critical role in conferring genetic susceptibility to gallbladder cancer in north Indian population 19 . However whether the genetic variants of CR1 are related to the risk of lung cancer remains unknown. In this case-control study we found an intronic SNP (rs7525160 G? ?C) with CC genotype was significantly associated with an increased risk of NSCLC. Consistently our results were in accordance with the study that genetic polymorphisms in innate immunity genes may play a role in the carcinogenesis of lung cancer 34 . It is likely that some genetic variations in strong link disequilibrium with this intronic SNP (rs7525160 G? ?C) are functional which provides a new insight into the hallmarks in susceptibility to lung cancer and further functional experiments are warranted to address the proposal. Functionally human CR1 exists on the surface of almost all peripheral blood cells and plays a key role in immune complex clearance and complement inhibition at the cell surface by binding to activated products C3b and C4b 435 . CR1 also possesses cofactor activity for the serum protease factor I and is thus involved in the generation of further fragments of C3 4b with the activation of complement cascade and the cellular immune response 4 . In our study the association of CR1 polymorphism with lung cancer is biologically plausible in that the intronic polymorphism could affect the density of CR1 molecules on the cell surface thereby contributing to autoimmune disorders and neoplasm. Tobacco smoking is an established risk factor for susceptibility to lung cancer. However not all people who suffer from lung cancer are smokers. Lung cancer in non-smokers can be induced by second hand smoke air pollutants and diesel exhaust 36-39 . Our present data showed significant difference of pack-year smoked but not smoking status between NSCLC cases and controls which suggested the important role of other environmental factors in the development of NSCLC. Tobacco could induce chronic and sustained inflammation in lung microenvironment contributing to pulmonary carcinogenesis in smokers 40 . Support also comes from the epidemiologic data regarding inflammation and lung cancer 41 . CR1 an important molecule implicated in immunity and inflammation could protect the host from invasion of exogenous chemicals derived from cigarette smoking. Genetic variant of CR1 could alter gene function and result in deregulation of the inflammatory and immune responses thereby modulating the susceptibility to lung cancer. More importantly we observed a potential interaction of this SNP (rs7525160 G? ?C) with smoking status suggesting the gene-environmental interaction plays a prominent role in the susceptibility to lung cancer. Our present study has its limitation. Our patients may not be representative of total NSCLC patients at large because they were recruited from only one hospital. In addition due to the relatively small sample size further case-control studies are still needed to replicate and extend our findings. Conclusion We conducted a case-control study in Chinese subjects and found an intronic SNP (rs7525160 G? ?C) of CR1 was significantly associated with lung cancer risk. To the best of our knowledge this study provides the first evidence that genetic variant of CR1 (rs7525160 G? ?C) was a smoking-modifying contributor to the development of lung cancer. Methods Study subjects This case-control study consisted of 470 patients with histopathologically confirmed NSCLC and 470 cancer-free controls. All subjects were genetic unrelated ethnic Han Chinese. Patients were recruited between January 2008 and December 2012 at Tangshan Gongren Hospital (Tangshan China). There were no age gender or stage restrictions however patients with previous malignancy or metastasized cancer from other organs were excluded. The response rate for patients was 94 . The controls were randomly selected from a pool of a cancer-free population from a nutritional survey conducted in the same region. The selection criteria for control subjects included: i) no individual history of cancer; ii) frequency matched to cases according to gender age ( 5 years); iii) the residential region; and iv) the time period for blood sample collection. At recruitment informed consent was obtained from each subject and each participant was then interviewed to collect detailed information on demographic characteristics. This study was approved by the institutional review board of Hebei United University. Tag SNPs selection and genotyping Based on the Chinese population data from HapMap database we used Haploview 4.2 program to select candidate tag SNPs with an r2 threshold of 0.80 and minor allele frequency (MAF) greater than 1 . Furthermore we also added two potential functional polymorphisms rs9429942 and rs6691117 4243 . Therefore we included 13 SNPs in our study which represents common genetic variants in Chinese population. Genotyping was performed at Bomiao Tech (Beijing China) using iPlex Gold Genotyping Asssy and Sequenom MassArray (Sequenom San Diego CA USA). Sequenom s MassArray Designer was used to design PCR and extension primers for each SNP. Primer information for selected tag SNPs was listed in Table 5.

Cells were collected by FCM. Data were analyzed with FlowJo software. Western Blot Analysis The western blot analysis was performed as described previously with some modifications 33 . Briefly 4T1 cells were treated with niclosamide in designed concentration for 24 hours then cells were washed with cold PBS twice and lysed in RIPA buffer. Protein concentrations were measured using the Lowry method and equalized before loading. Equal amounts of total protein from each sample was applied to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gels and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Amersham Bioscience Piscataway NJ). After electrophoresis the membranes were blocked for 2 h at 37 C and incubated with specific primary antibodies overnight at 4 C followed by the secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. The reactive bands were detected using a commercially available enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Piscataway NJ). Boyden Chamber Migration and Invasion Assay Boyden chamber (8 µm pore size) migration assay was performed as previously described with some modification 34 . Briefly 5 104 4T1 cells or MDA-MB-231 cells in 100 µl serum-free medium were added in the top chamber then 600 µl of medium with 10 FBS was added to the bottom chamber. Different concentrations of niclosamide were added in both chambers. Cells were allowed to migrate for 20 hours. Non-migrated cells in the top chamber were removed. The migrated cells were fixed in 4 paraformaldehyde and stained with 0.5 crystal violet. Migrated cells were counted and photographed under a light microscope. Invasion assay was conducted according to previous study 34 . Briefly the upper surface of the transwell plate was coated with 60 µl Matrigel (BD Biosciences). After Matrigel polymerization the bottom chambers were filled with 500 µl medium containing 10 FBS. 5 104 4T1 cells or MDA-MB-231 cells in 100 µl serum-free medium were added in the upper part of each transwell and treated with different concentrations of niclosamide. After incubation for 20 hours non-migrated cells on the top side of the filter were removed and migrated cells were fixed with 100 methanol and stained with 0.5 crystal violet then migrated cells were counted and photographed under a light microscope. Percentage of migrated cells inhibited by niclosamide was quantified. Mice and Tumor Model All animal experiments were approved and conducted by the Institutional Animal Care and Treatment Committee of Sichuan University in China (Permit Number: 20121101). Female BALB c mice (Six- to eight-week-old) used in this study were obtained from Beijing HFK bioscience CO. Ltd Beijing China. Briefly 100 µL 4T1 tumor cell suspension containing 1.0 106 cells were injected subcutaneously in the right flank of BALB c mice. About seven days after inoculation tumor cells the tumor-bearing mice were randomized into three groups (8 mice per group) and received intraperitoneally injection (i.p.) of niclosamide 20 mg kg 10 mg kg or vehicle respectively once daily for 21 days. Tumor volumes and body weight were assessed every three days. The tumor size was calculated according to the formula: Tumor volume (mm3)? ?0.52 L W2 where L is the length and W is the width. Moreover when all animals were euthanized by cervical dislocation the lungs were harvested total number of lung metastases was counted. Immunohistochemistry Immunohistochemistry staining of tumor sections were described previously 18 . One part of paraffin tumor sections was stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H E). The other part was stained with Ki67 cleaved casepase-3 VEGF antibodies using immunohistochemistry staining to investigate tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis respectively. In addition paraffin-embeded tumor sections were stained with an anti-CD31 antibody to examine blood vessel density. Images were taken with Leica microscope (Leica DM4000B). Toxicity Evaluation To test potential side effects or toxicity on mice during the treatment all the animals were observed continuously for relevant indexes such as body weight anorexia diarrhea and other clinical symptoms. At the 28th day all animals were euthanized by cervical dislocation after taking blood from eyeball. Blood was obtained for blood routine analysis by Nihon Kohden MEK-5216K Automatic Hematology Analyzer. The tissues of heart lung spleen liver and kidney were stained with H E for histopathologic examination. Statistical Analysis Data represented as means SD of three independent experiments. The statistical comparisons were made by Student s T test and statistically significant p values were labeled as follows: P 0.05; P 0.01; P 0.001. Results The Anti-proliferation Effects of Niclosamide against Breast Cancer Cells In order to investigate whether niclosamide has direct effects on breast cancer cells we tested the proliferation inhibition caused by niclosamide treatment on different breast cancer cell lines by MTT. After exposure to niclosamide for 72 h the IC50 of MDA-MB-231 MCF-7 MDA-MB-468 were 0.95 µM 1.05 µM and 1.88 µM respectively (A). Exposure of 4T1 cells to niclosamide for 24 h 48 h and 72 h respectively resulted in decrease of the cell proliferation (B). Therefore these results demonstrated that niclosamide inhibited breast cancer cells proliferation in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Thus we chose 4T1 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines for further experiments. .0085887.g001 The effect of niclosamide on breast cancer cells viability. (A) Proliferation of MDA-MB-231 MCF-7 MDA-MB-468 cells treated with various concentrations (0 10 µM) of niclosamide for 72 hours respectively. Cell viability was detected by MTT assay. The data are expressed as the means SD from three independent experiments. (B) MTT assays showed niclosamide inhibited 4T1 breast cancer cells proliferation concentration- and time-dependently. Values represented means SD from three experiments ( p 0.05; p 0.01; p 0.001). (C) The effects of niclosamide (a-f:0 1.25 µM) on colony formation in 4T1 cells 12 days the statistic results of colony formation assays presented as surviving colonies. Data are expressed as means SD from three experiments ( p 0.05; p 0.01). (D) The fluorescence microscopic appearance of Hoechst 33342 staining nuclei of 4T1 cells with various concentration niclosamide for 24 h (40 ). Data are the representative from three parallel experiments. To further determine whether niclosamide could inhibit the proliferation of 4T1 we conducted colony formation assay after niclosamide treatment. As shown in C clonogenic assay clearly showed that clone formation of 4T1 cells was reduced in a concentration-dependent manner after exposure to niclosamide. Furthermore the size of the colonies treated with niclosamide was significantly smaller than the control. Induction of Apoptosis by Niclosamide As D indicates the 4T1 cells exhibited features of apoptosis as showed by Hoechst 33342 staining such as bright-blue fluorescent condensed nuclei nuclear fragmentation and reduction of cell volume. To further confirm the induction of apoptosis in 4T1 cells with niclosamide treatment we also investigated the levels of apoptosis using the AnnexinV-FITC PI dual-labeling technique by FCM. As shown in A and B after niclosamide treatment for 24 h the apoptosis induction effect was apparently observed. When the 4T1 cells were treated with 1.25 µM niclosamide the apoptosis rate was 13.7 whereas the apoptosis cells increased to 19.0 25.5 and 31.3 when cells were treated with 2.5 µM 5 µM and 10 µM niclosamide respectively. Moreover we examined Bcl-2 Mcl-1 Survivin and cleaved caspase-3 expression levels in 4T1 cells after niclosamide-treated for 24 h by western blotting analysis. The expression of Bcl-2 Mcl-1 and Survivin significantly decreased while that of cleaved caspase-3 increased in a concentration-dependent manner (C) which was coincident with the results of Hoechst 33342 staining and FCM assays. .0085887.g002 Niclosamid induces 4T1 breast cancer cells apoptosis. (A) 4T1 cells were treated with niclosamide at indicated doses for 24 hours and the level of apoptosis was evaluated using the Annexin V PI dual-labeling technique as determined by FCM. Data shown are representative of three independent experiments. (B) Statistic results of apoptosis assays 4T1 cells positive for both Annexin V and PI were considered apoptotic. Data are expressed as means SD from three independent experiments ( p 0.05; p 0.01). (C) Western blot analyses of 4T1 cells treated (24 h) with different concentrations of niclosamide to evaluate protein expression of Bcl-2 Mcl-1 Cleaved caspase-3 Survivin and ?-actin was employed as a standard. Niclosamide Suppresses Breast Cancer Cell Migration and Invasion Breast cancer metastasis poses a predominant threat to cancer related mortality. Moreover one of the key steps in successful cancer metastasis is tumor cell migration and invasion 34 35 . Therefore in order to examine whether niclosamide could inhibit breast cancer cell migration and invasion we performed transwell migration and invasion assays on 4T1 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines. As shown in Figure 3A niclosamide-treated groups showed reduced migrated cell numbers on 4T1 cells similar results was obtained in invasion assay (Figure 3B). Meanwhile niclosamide obviously inhibited MDA-MB-231 migration and invasion were also observed (Figure 3C). Moreover we also investigated whether Stat3 Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) and Src which are considered to be related with cell migration and invasion are involved in niclosamide-mediated migration and invasion 34 . As Figure 3D indicates niclosamide treatment decreased the expression of phosphorylated-STAT3 (Tyr705) phosphorylated-FAK (Tyr925) and phosphorylated-Src (Tyr416) without affecting their total expression level. Taken together these results suggested that niclosamide could suppress breast cancer cell migration and invasion in a concentration-dependent manner. .0085887.g003 Figure 3 Niclosamide inhibits breast cancer cell 4T1 and MDA-MB-231 migration and invasion and inhibits FAK-involved pathway. (A) A total of 5 104 4T1 cells were seeded in the top chamber of transwell with serum-free medium and treated with different concentration of niclosamide. After 20 hours migrated cells were stained photographed (10 ) and quantified. (B) A total of 5 104 4T1 cells were treated with various concentration of niclosamide and allowed to invade through Matrigel and Transwell membrance Invaded cell number was stained photographed (20 ) and counted. (C) Niclosamide inhibited MDA-MB-231 migation and invasion. The number of migrated cells and invaded cells was counted respectively. Data represent means SD. (n? ?3 in triplicate; p 0.05; p 0.01; p 0.001). (D) 4T1 cells were treated with different concentration of niclosamide (0 5 µM). After 24 hours cell lysates were blotted with spectfic antibodies (anti-phospho-STAT3 anti-phospho-FAK anti-phospho-Src STAT3 FAK and Src) ?-actin was the loading control. Anti-tumor Efficacy of Niclosamide in 4T1 Mouse Mammary Tumor Model To study the antitumor activity of niclosamide in vivo 4T1 tumor-bearing mice were treated with niclosamide at the dose of 10 mg kg and 20 mg kg. From the results (Figure 4A) it was found that the tumor growth of the niclosamide groups become slowed 7 days after treatment. After 21 days treatment niclosamide substantially suppressed tumor growth in a dose-dependent manner compared with the control. Moreover after treatment with niclosamide for 21 days body weight of the mice were statisticed and no significant differences in body weight were found among the three groups (Figure 4B). Furthermore previous studies have showed that 4T1 mouse breast cancer have a high metastatic potential and spontaneously metastasize to secondary foci from the primary sites and one of the fatal metastatic organs is lung as early as 2 weeks after inoculation 36 37 . In the present study we seek to evaluate whether treatment of niclosamide could reduce the occurrence of lung metastasis. The data in Figure 4C and D showed that niclosamide-treated at 20 mg kg resulted in significant reduction in the number of lung metastases compared with other groups. In addition histological analyses proved that the number of micrometastatic nodules per field in the niclosamide-treated at 20 mg kg group was also significant fewer than other groups (Figure 4C). These results further indicated that high dose of niclosamide could inhibit tumor metastasis in breast cancer. .0085887.g004 Figure 4 Effect of niclosamide treatment on primary tumor growth and pulmonary metastasis. (A) 4T1 tumor-bearing female BALB c mice were treated as described with vehicle niclosamide at 10 and 20 mg kg the mean tumor volumes SD of six mice per every group. (B) After 28 days of tumor cell inoculation the body weight of the niclosamide treatment and vehicle groups were statisticed and there were no significant difference among the groups. (C) Lung metastatic nodules were visualized to show the inhibitory effect of niclosamide on 4T1 tumor 21 days after treatment. Arrow indicated metastatic nodules (up) The H E staining of lungs from each group (10 ). (D) The mean lung metastasis nodules of each group the treatment with niclosamide at 20 mg kg resulted in significant inhibition of lung metastasis versus vehicle control.\nLabels: [Thyroid_Cancer, Colon_Cancer, Lung_Cancer]\nReply with one label only.", "assistant": "Lung_Cancer"}
{"system": "You are a medical text classifier. Choose exactly one label.", "user": "Text: Methods Tissue collection We obtained 113 paired NSCLC and adjacent non-tumor lung tissues from patients who underwent surgery at Jiangsu Province Hospital between 2008 and 2010 and were diagnosed with NSCLC (stages I II and III) based on histopathological evaluation. Clinicopathological characteristics including tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging were recorded. No local or systemic treatment was conducted in these patients before surgery. All collected tissue samples were immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 C until required. Our study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Nanjing Medical University China. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. Cell lines Five NSCLC adenocarcinoma cell lines (A549 SPC-A1 NCI-H1975 NCI-H1299 and NCI-H1650) a NSCLC squamous carcinomas cell line (SK-MES-1) and a normal human bronchial epithelial cell line (16HBE) were purchased from the Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai China). A549 SK-MES-1 NCI-H1975 NCI-H1299 NCI-H1650 and 16HBE cells were cultured in RPMI 1640; SPC-A1 cells were cultured in DMEM (GIBCO-BRL) medium supplemented with 10 fetal bovine serum (FBS) 100 U ml penicillin and 100 mg ml streptomycin (Invitrogen Carlsbad CA USA) at 37ºC 5 CO2. RNA extraction and qPCR assays Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer s instructions. Total RNA (500 ng) was reverse transcribed in a final volume of 10 ?l using random primers under standard conditions for the PrimeScript RT reagent Kit (TaKaRa Dalian China). We used the SYBR Premix Ex Taq (TaKaRa Dalian China) to determine BANCR expression levels following the manufacturer s instructions. Results were normalized to the expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). The specific primers used are presented in Additional file 3: Table S2. The qPCR assays were conducted on an ABI 7500 and data collected with this instrument. Our qPCR results were analyzed and expressed relative to threshold cycle (CT) values and then converted to fold changes. Plasmid generation The BANCR sequence was synthesized and subcloned into the pCDNA3.1 (Invitrogen Shanghai China) vector. Ectopic expression of BANCR was achieved through pCDNA-BANCR transfection with an empty pCDNA3.1 vector used as a control. The expression levels of BANCR were detected by qPCR. Cell transfection Plasmid vectors (pCDNA3.1-BANCR and pCDNA3.1) for transfection were prepared using DNA Midiprep or Midiprep kits (Qiagen Hilden Germany) and transfected into SPC-A1 or A549 cells. The siRNAs si-HDAC1 si-HDAC3 si-BANCR or si-NC were transfected into SPC-A1 or A549 cells (Additional file 3: Table S2). A549 and SPC-A1 cells were grown on six-well plates to confluency and transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer s instructions. At 48 h post-transfection cells were harvested for qPCR or western blot analysis. Cell viability assays Cell viability was monitored using a Cell Proliferation Reagent Kit I (MTT) (Roche Applied Science). The A549 cells transfected with si-BANCR (3000 cells well) and A549 or SPC-A1 cells transfected with pCDNA-BANCR were grown in 96-well plates. Cell viability was assessed every 24 h following the manufacturer s protocol. All experiments were performed in quadruplicate. For colony formation assays pCDNA-BANCR-transfected SPC-A1 or A549 cells (n? ?500) were placed in a 6-well plates and maintained in media containing 10 FBS. The medium was replaced every 4 days; after 14 days cells were fixed with methanol and stained with 0.1 crystal violet (Sigma-Aldrich). Visible colonies were then counted. For each treatment group wells were assessed in triplicate. Flow cytometry analysis of apoptosis SPC-A1 and A549 cells were harvested at 48 h post-transfection by trypsinization. After staining with FITC-Annexin V and propidium iodide cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (FACScan; BD Biosciences) using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). Cells were discriminated into viable cells dead cells early apoptotic cells and apoptotic cells. The ratio of early apoptotic cells was compared to that for controls from each experiment. All samples were assayed in triplicate. Wound-healing assay For the wound-healing assay 3? ?105 cells were seeded in 6-well plates cultured overnight and transfected with pCDNA-BANCR or the control vector. Once cultures reached 85 confluency the cell layer was scratched with a sterile plastic tip and washed with culture medium then cultured for 48 h with medium containing 1 FBS. At different time points images of the plates were acquired using a microscope. The distance between the two edges of the scratch was measured using Digimizer software system. Cell migration and invasion assays For the migration assays at 48 h post-transfection 5? ?104 cells in serum-free media were placed into the upper chamber of an insert (8-?m pore size; Millipore). For the invasion assays 1? ?105 cells in serum-free medium were placed into the upper chamber of an insert coated with Matrigel (Sigma-Aldrich). Medium containing 10 FBS was added to the lower chamber. After incubation for 24 h the cells remaining on the upper membrane were removed with cotton wool. Cells that had migrated or invaded through the membrane were stained with methanol and 0.1 crystal violet imaged and counted using an IX71 inverted microscope (Olympus Tokyo Japan). Experiments were independently repeated three times. Tail vein injections into athymic mice Athymic male mice (4-weeks-old) were purchased from the Animal Center of the Chinese Academy of Science (Shanghai China) and maintained in laminar flow cabinets under specific pathogen-free conditions. SPC-A1 cells transfected with pCDNA-BANCR or the empty vector were harvested from 6-well plates washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and resuspended at 2? ?107 cells ml. Suspended cells (0.1 ml) were injected into the tail veins of 9 mice which were sacrificed 7 weeks after injection. The lungs were removed and photographed and visible tumors on the lung surface were counted.\nLabels: [Thyroid_Cancer, Colon_Cancer, Lung_Cancer]\nReply with one label only.", "assistant": "Lung_Cancer"}

Background To evaluate the evidence comparing video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) and open thoracotomy in the treatment of metastatic lung cancer using meta-analytical techniques. Methods A literature search was undertaken until July 2013 to identify the comparative studies evaluating disease-free survival rates and survival rates. The pooled odds ratios (OR) and the 95 confidence intervals (95 CI) were calculated with the fixed or random effect models. Results Six retrospective studies were included in our meta-analysis. These studies included a total of 546 patients: 235 patients were treated with VATS and 311 patients were treated with open thoracotomy. The VATS and the thoracotomy did not demonstrate a significant difference in the 1-3-5-year survival rates and the 1-year disease-free survival rate. There were significant statistical differences between the 3-year disease free survival rate (p? ?0.04) which favored open thoracotomy. Conclusions The VATS approach is a safe and feasible treatment in terms of the survival rate for metastatic lung cancer compared with the thoracotomy. The 3-year disease-free survival rate in the VATS group is inferior to that of open thoracotomy. The VATS approach could not completely replace open thoracotomy. The authors have no support or funding to report. Introduction Metastasectomy is considered a beneficial treatment for a patient with metastatic lung cancer whose primary tumor has been well controlled 1 .After surgery 5-year survival rates of 30 to 50 could be achieved depending on the underlying primary cancer 2 4 .In practice the surgical approaches to pulmonary metastases are variable. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is an emerging technique; many procedures that had previously required a thoracotomy have been performed with the minimally invasive VATS. VATS has been used for the treatment of pulmonary metastases. The routine use of VATS for the treatment of respectable metastatic lung cancer remains controversial. Critics of the VATS approach have argued that it might not be an equivalent oncological operation 5 6 . A prospective study by Cerfolio 7 found that 22 of the nodules that could be detected by thoracotomy were missing by VATS.Whether the VATS approach can provide a satisfactory outcome is unknown. An evidenced-based investigation of the VATS approach is needed we undertook this meta-analysis to achieve a more objective assessment of the published studies and to provide a more accurate comparison between VATS and thoracotomy for metastatic lung cancer. Methods Search Strategy Electronic searches were of the MEDLINECochrane Controlled Trial Register (CENTRAL) Ovid MEDILINE PubMed and Embase databases were performed until July 2013.The following MeSH search headings were used: metastatic lung cancer pulmonary metastases video-assisted thoracic surgery thoracotomy and comparative study .We searched the reference lists of relevant studies reviews editorials lettersand meeting abstracts. We used the Science Citation Index to cross-reference for further studies that met our criteria. Study Selection The studies included in this meta-analysis were based on our predetermined criteria as follows: (1) clinical trials that include the full text of the paper published in peer-reviewed English journals or reports of presentations at major thoracic surgery meetings; (2) comparison of the efficacy of VATS to that of thoracotomy in patients with metastatic lung cancer; and (3) similarity in the patients' baseline characteristics. Data extraction and quality assessment Two independent reviewers (Siyuan and Wenya) assessed the quality and the risk of bias of the included trials as follows: (1) the studies that did not include a comparative group with surgery as a form of intervention were excluded; (2) the trials focusing on patients undergoing surgery for primary lung cancer were excluded; (3) the studies on robotic video-assisted thoracic surgery were excluded; (4) if there was an overlap between authors centers or patient cohorts evaluated in the published literature only the most recent report was included; (5) studies published more than 20 years ago were excluded because of the significant technological changes that has occurred. The s were evaluated with the Downs and Black quality assessment method 8 . Discrepancies between the two investigators were resolved by discussion and consensus with a senior investigator. The final results were reviewed by two senior investigators (Lin and Jiang).The disease-free survival was defined as the date of the initial metastasectomy until the date of a recurrence.

Background We aimed to evaluate the clinical significance of microvessel density (MVD) lymphatic vessel density (LVD) and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in relation to tumor location in advanced colorectal cancer (CRC). Methods Using immunohistochemistry we examined 181 advanced CRC patients for CD31 and D2-40 to measure MVD and LVD respectively ?-smooth muscle actin (SMA) and desmin to identify CAFs and PTEN to examine genetic changes of CAFs. To evaluate the regional heterogeneity of these properties we examined tissue from four sites (the center and periphery of the primary cancer a distant metastasis and a lymph node metastasis) in each patient. Results MVD LVD and CAFs showed significant heterogeneity with respect to the tumor location. LVD was the greatest in the center of the primary cancers and the amount of CAFs was the lowest in distant metastases. In distant metastases those from the lung had higher LVD and MVD but fewer CAFs than those from the liver peritoneum or ovary. Patients with low MVD and LVD in the center of the primary cancer had worse outcomes and patients with few CAFs in distant metastases and in the primary tumor had a lower survival rate. PTEN expression in CAFs in distant metastases was lost in 11 of 181 CRC patients (6.1 ) which was associated with a worse prognosis. Conclusions The microenvironment including cancer-associated microvasculature and fibroblasts is heterogeneous with respect to the tumor location in CRC patients. Therefore heterogeneity of microenvironments should be taken into account when managing CRC patients. This study was supported by grant number 03-2011-012 from the Seoul National University Bundang Hospital Research Fund. The funder had no role in study design data collection and analysis decision to publish or preparation of the manuscript. Introduction Although the mortality rates of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients have decreased in most western countries and in several developing countries in Asia advanced CRC patients who initially present with stage IV disease or those who develop distant metastases several months after diagnosis still have a lower five-year survival rate 1 2 ._ENREF_4 Recently the range of systemic chemotherapy has expanded and targeted therapy including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor therapies have been used in advanced CRC patients increasing patient survival 3 . However some CRC patients respond poorly to targeted therapy despite presenting positive results in targeted therapy-specific mutation studies 4 . One possible explanation for this therapeutic failure is tumor heterogeneity; several studies have reported that CRCs possess a heterogenic genotype or phenotype including KRAS p53 and BRAF 5 7 . Therefore the differing characteristics of the primary tumor site and the corresponding metastatic an need to be clarified to improve the management of CRC patients with metastatic diseases. Furthermore understanding the clinicopathological characteristics of advanced CRC is important for the development and improvement of systemic therapies. Since Paget et al. first described the cancer microenvironment by the seed and soil theory 8 there has been growing evidence that cancer-associated stroma might affect the cancer cells themselves and contribute to cancer progression 9 . The main components of the cancer microenvironment are microvasculature (microvessels and lymphatic vessels) inflammatory cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) 10 12 . The current method of verifying angiogenetic and lymphangiogenetic activity in cancer tissue is to assess microvessel density (MVD) and lymphatic vessel density (LVD) respectively. MVD has been proposed as a surrogate marker of cancer-associated angiogenesis to identify patients with a high risk of recurrence or those with poor prognoses for various cancers including CRC 13 14 ; however the prognostic correlation of angiogenesis in CRC is still controversial 15 16 . Similar to angiogenesis LVD has received interest as a means of lymphatic metastasis and survival 17 18 but its role in tumor progression is still unclear 19 . The other prominent component of stroma CAFs are consistently activated and affect many aspects of tumor initiation invasion and progression 9 . While some studies have suggested that CAFs may inhibit tumor progression 20 21 other studies have proposed that CAFs may promote progression in prostate breast and skin cancers 22 24 . In the context of CRC Tsujino et al. have suggested that ?-smooth muscle actin (SMA)-expressing CAFs might be a useful indicator of poor prognosis. However these results were restricted to stage II and III CRCs 25 . In addition to cancer cells genetic alterations in CAFs have demonstrated including the loss of heterozygosity microsatellite instability and genetic mutations 26 27 . Recently genetic inactivation of PTEN in CAFs was reported in breast cancer patients 28 . Trimboli et al. identified that PTEN loss in stromal fibroblasts resulted in extensive extracellular matrix remodeling and angiogenesis which characteristic of tumor progression 28 . However expression loss of PTEN and its clinical significance have not been investigated in colorectal cancer patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics of microenvironments including microvasculatures and CAFs in advanced CRC patients.

We detected strong cis-meQTLs for DNMT1 a gene known for establishment and regulation of tissue-specific patterns of methylated cytosine residues and for DNMT3A B two genes involved in de novo methylation in mammals but not for MTHFR which affects global methylation (Supplementary Fig. 1e). The likelihood of detecting cis-meQTLs varied across CpG regions and strongly depended on the variability of the methylation levels (Fig. 1d e). CpG probes in non-CGI regions were twice as likely to harbor cis-meQTLs than CpG probes in CGI regions (11.5 v.s. 4.8 t-test P 10?100); similarly CpG probes located in CGI of non-gene regions were twice as likely to harbor cis meQTL than those in gene regions (14.6 v.s. 6.6 t-test P 10?100). To verify the cis-meQTLs we analyzed data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)22 NSCLC patients (n 65) for whom both DNA methylation data from llumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip of histologically normal lung tissue and germline genotypes from Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 were available. Genetic associations were tested using the imputed genotypic dosages. EAGLE findings were strongly replicated in TCGA lung data: for the 34304 associations detected in EAGLE32128 (93.8 ) had the same direction and 22441 (65.4 ) had FDR 0.05 based on single-sided P-values (). For 34304 CpG probes detected with cis-meQTLs we searched for secondary independently associated SNPs in cis regions by conditioning on the primary cis-meQTL SNPs. We detected secondary cis-meQTL SNPs for 3546 CpG probes (FDR 5 P 4 10?5) 61.5 of which were replicated in TCGA lung data. Identification of trans-acting meQTLs Identification of trans-meQTLs was performed by searching for SNPs that were on different chromosomes from the target CpG-sites or on the same chromosome but more than 500kb away. We detected 615 CpG-probes with trans-meQTLs (FDR 5 P 2.5 10?10) including 438 interchromosomal and 177 intrachromosomal trans-meQTLs. Among 177 intrachromosomal trans-associations 30 lost significance after conditioning on the corresponding cis-regulating SNPs suggesting that these trans-associations were caused by cis-acting regulations through long range linkage disequilibrium (LD). Thus we detected 585 traits with true trans-meQTLs (Fig. 2a) mapping to 373 genes. The number of trans-meQTLs was reduced to 500 if controlling for FDR 1 (P 4.0 10?11). We replicated 79.8 of the 585 trans-associations in TCGA lung data. Interestingly trans-meQTLs were strongly enriched in CGI sites in contrast to the observation that cis-meQTLs were strongly enriched in non-CGI sites (Fig. 2b). CpG dinucleotides in 3 UTR regions where microRNA target sites are typically located showed an opposite trend in both cis- and trans-meQTLs (Fig. 2b). In 62.8 of the trans-associations the SNPs involved were also detected to have cis-acting effects. We investigated whether trans-associations were mediated by these cis-regulated proximal CpG sites (Fig. 2cd). We found that 30 and 166 trans-associations had full and partial mediation respectively while 389 had no significant mediation. The trans-associations involving SNPs in gene desert regions are less likely to be mediated by proximal CpG probes (15.7 v.s. 34.3 ; P 0.0067 Fisher s exact test). To obtain mechanistic insight into the trans-associations showing mediation effects (n 196) we used the DAVID tool23 to characterize the function of genes harboring the mediating cis-CpG probes. The analysis was performed for 115 genes after excluding the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region because of long range complex LD patterns. The GO analysis revealed three top gene categories with nominal significance involved in DNA methylation regulation including GTPase-activity related genes (P 0.004 Fisher s exact test) genes regulating transcription (P 0.02) and genetic imprinting (P 0.04 Fisher s exact test Supplementary ). Notably 106 trans SNPs with P 2.5 10?10 were associated with multiple distal CpG probes suggesting that they are multi-CpG regulators. In particular we detected one master regulatory SNP rs12933229 located at 16p11.2 in a very large intron of the NPIPL1 gene which was associated with the methylation of CpG sites annotated to five genes on different chromosomes (Fig. 2a Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary ). These associations were partially mediated by a proximal CpG probe cg06871736. All five trans-associations were replicated in TCGA. The trans-associations show a consistent direction with the C allele associated with higher methylation levels. All five regulated target sites are in CGIs and three are in gene promoter regions. We evaluated the association with gene expression for these three CpG probes using 28 TCGA histologically normal lung tissue samples with RNA sequencing data. Based on this limited sample size two of the target genes PABPC4 and STARD3 showed decreased expression with increased methylation (FDR 10 ). Enrichment of meQTLs in DNA regulatory regions SNPs associated with complex diseases in GWAS or with eQTLs have been reported to be enriched in ENCODE-annotated regulatory regions2425. These include DNaseI hypersensitivity sites CCTC-binding factor (CTCF) binding sites and regions enriched in- active and repressive histone modification marks. The large number of meQTLs detected in our study both cis and trans enabled us to systematically investigate their enrichment in regulatory regions. We performed enrichment analysis using Chip-Seq data in small airway epithelial cells (SAEC) from the ENCODE project for histone marks26 CTCF occupancy27 and DNaseI hypersensitivity sites28; and histone marks in primary human alveolar epithelial cells (hAEC) from our own laboratory29. Compared to the control SNP set not associated with the methylation of CpG sites (with minor allele frequency and CpG probe density matched with meQTL SNPs) the meQTL SNPs were strongly enriched for sites of CTCF DNaseI hypersensitivity and histone marks (H3K4me3 H3K9-14Ac and H3K36me3) associated with active promoters enhancers and active transcription and to a lesser extent for the repressive mark H3K27me3 (). Enrichment of all regulatory regions became stronger with increasing significance of association with the exception of the H3K27me3 repressive mark (Fig. 3). Using SAEC CTCF ChIP data we found that meQTL SNPs or associated SNPs in high LD located within CTCF consensus sequences can affect allele-specific binding of CTCF (see two examples in Supplementary Fig. 3 and 4). Lung cancer risk SNPs affect methylation in human lung tissue To determine whether the identified meQTLs might provide functional annotation to the established genetic associations with lung cancer risks we examined SNPs in five genomic regions reported to be associated with lung cancer risk in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of populations of European ancestry: 15q25.130 32 (CHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNB4) 5p15.33203334 6p21.3333 (BAT3 most strongly associated with squamous cell carcinoma or SQ) 12p13.335 (RAD52 for SQ) and 9p21.336 (CDKN2A CDKN2B particularly for SQ). The GWAS SNPs at 15q25.1 were reported to be associated with total expression levels and multiple isoforms of CHRNA5 in normal lung tissue samples3738. The GWAS SNPs at the other four loci have not been reported to be associated with the total expression of nearby genes. Consistently we did not observe an association in RNA-seq data from TCGA lung normal tissue samples (n 59) although a detailed investigation of alternative promoters splice sites and allele-specific gene expression in larger studies is warranted. Here we investigated whether these SNPs contributed to lung cancer risk with epigenetic regulation by examining their associations with DNA methylation levels. The top GWAS SNPs located at 15q25.1 5p15.33 6p21.33 and 12p13.3 were all strongly associated with the methylation of the nearby CpG probes and the associations were replicated in TCGA lung data (Fig. 4). Importantly five of the six GWAS SNPs at these loci excluding the RAD52 locus were also the SNPs with the strongest association with the corresponding CpG probes. For the cg22937753 probe located in the RAD52 locus another SNP rs724709 with weak correlation with the GWAS SNP (r2 0.1) had the strongest association with meQTL. All involved CpG sites are located within gene bodies (which may affect gene splicing39) or the 3 UTR regions. No meQTL was detected for 9p21.3 (Supplementary Fig. 5) possibly because of fewer CpG dinucleotide probes available in this gene region on the Illumina platform. The location of these lung cancer GWAS-associated CpG sites might identify which genes within the relevant regions are more likely associated with the risk SNPs something that is particularly important for regions with complex LD structure as the MHC region on 6p21. In MHC two GWAS SNPs in complete LD (r2 1) rs3117582 (BAT3) and rs3131379 (MSH5) were most strongly associated with the methylation of CpG sites located nearby of MSH5 (involved in DNA mismatch repair and meiotic recombination process) suggesting that MSH5 (P 5.4 10?13 t-test) is more likely to be involved in lung carcinogenesis than BAT3 (P 8.8 10?5 t-test) or that the SNP closer to MSH5 (rs3131379) is more likely to be the SNP most responsible of the GWAS association with lung cancer risk (Fig. 4b). Our meQTL data also show that rs3131379 trans-regulated the methylation level of CpG probe cg12093005 located in the body of FBRSL1 at 12q24 (PEAGLE 4.0 10?9 PTCGA 7.2 10?4 and Pcombined 5. 4 10?11 t-test). Thus this known GWAS locus might affect lung cancer risk through a gene located on a different chromosome. Of note on the 15q25.1 locus two independent lung cancer risk SNPs rs2036534 and rs1051730 were associated with CpG probes not linked with CHRNA5 expression. In Supplementary Fig. 6 we show that the two SNPs jointly regulated another methylation probe cg22563815 within the CHRNA5 promoter which is associated with CHRNA5 expression. This extends and further confirms the complex regulatory pattern with multiple SNPs previously observed for this locus35. Most subjects in the analyses were smokers (n 206). Adjustment for smoking status (former and current) or intensity (pack years) did not change the results. cis-meQTLs are enriched in lung squamous cell carcinoma risk We investigated whether the identified cis-meQTL SNPs were enriched in the National Cancer Institute (NCI) lung cancer GWAS including 5739 cases and 5848 controls of European ancestry19. To focus on potentially new genetic risk associations we excluded the top lung cancer GWAS SNPs mentioned above and their surrounding regions. We tested the enrichment by examining whether the GWAS P-values for the LD-pruned cis-meQTL SNPs deviated from the uniform distribution i.e. no enrichment. When all cis-meQTL SNPs were analyzed together we detected a strong enrichment for overall lung cancer risk (P 10?4 based on 10000 permutations) which was primarily driven by the enrichment in SQ (P 10?4 based on 10000 permutations) (Fig. 5a). The genomic control ?-values based on genome-wide SNPs showed that the type-I error rates of our enrichment test were not inflated (? 1.01 and 1.00 for overall lung cancer and SQ respectively). Stratified analyses further refined the enrichment to the cis-meQTL SNPs regulating CpG-sites mapping to north shore (Fig. 5b) and gene body (Fig. 5c) regions (see Supplementary Fig. 7 for the quantile-quantile plot). These gene bodies and north shores were enriched for genes involved in cancer pathways (P 2.5 10?4 Fisher s exact test) and particularly those in NSCLC pathway (e.g. AKT1 MAPK1 RASSF5 etc. Supplementary Table 4). In contrast cis-meQTLs related with CGI regions or promoters were not enriched with the risk of overall lung cancer or any lung cancer subtype further emphasizing the need to comprehensively study the methylome to identify functional mechanisms for GWAS findings and identify new genetic loci. Because the meQTL SNPs affecting CpG sites in gene body non-CGI regions were mostly enriched for SQ risk (Fig. 5d) we performed further analysis in this category by integrating the ENCODE SAEC data. We chose SAEC data because this cell type may be involved in SQ development. We restricted enrichment analysis to the regulatory meQTL SNPs which localized in the CTCF binding regions DNaseI hypersensitive sites or histone marks (H3K27me3 H3K4me3 and H3K36me3) or had at least one LD SNP (r2? 0.95) residing in these regions. The strong enrichment in SQ was driven by SNPs overlapping with CTCF binding sites (P 10?4 based on 10000 permutations) or the repressive mark H3K27me3 (P 10?4 based on 10000 permutations) (Fig. 5e). The enrichment test was not significant after excluding the SNPs overlapping with these regulatory regions (P 0.14 based on 10000 permutations). Replication of meQTLs in TCGA breast and kidney tissues To explore the tissue-specificity of the genetic effects on DNA methylation we examined whether the meQTLs detected in EAGLE lung tissue data could be replicated in TCGA breast (n 87) or kidney (n 142) histologically normal tissue samples the only two organs to date with data available for a large number of normal tissues of European ancestry. Results are in and Supplementary Fig. 8. For both cis- and trans- meQTLs a large proportion of associations had the same direction of EAGLE meQTLs in both breast and kidney samples. For cis-associations 54.7 and 70.0 were replicated with FDR 5 based on single-sided P-values in two data sets respectively. For the strong cis associations with P 10?10 in EAGLE the replication rates increased to 82.7 and 89.2 in the two data sets. For trans- associations 83.4 and 86.4 were replicated in breast and kidney samples respectively. The detected master regulator (Fig 2a) was strongly replicated in both data sets (Supplementary ). Interestingly some cis-meQTLs but not trans-meQTLs had an opposite but very strong association (P 10?6) in breast (n 7) or kidney (n 58) compared with the EAGLE lung data a phenomenon previously reported in a cell-type specific eQTL study40. Discussion We found that inherited genetic variation profoundly and extensively impacts DNA methylation in target organs. Based on high-density methylation arrays in a large sample size we identified 34304 cis-meQTLs and 585 trans-meQTLs one to two orders of magnitude larger compared to previous studies3 57. meQTLs involved nearly half of the autosomal genes of which 9330 in cis and 373 in trans with 9525 unique genes in total. We show that approximately 10 of the cis-meQTLs were affected by at least two SNPs independently. Moreover we detected a master regulator SNP associated with the methylation levels of five CpG probes on different chromosomes demonstrating the existence of regulatory hotspots for DNA methylation as previously shown for eQTL4142. Most meQTLs were replicated in independent histologically normal lung tissue samples from TCGA. We also showed a high similarity of genetic control on DNA methylation across different tissues. Our findings show that genetic effects on DNA methylation are extensive in scale and complex in structure across the whole genome and suggest a series of important biological implications. First our results show that the genomic architecture surrounding cis- and trans-meQTLs is distinct. cis-meQTLs are very large in number impact predominantly the CpG sites mapping to non-gene regions and when they occur in genes are mostly in non-promoter and non-CpG island regions. In contrast trans-meQTLs are rarer mainly affect promoter CGI regions and may be associated with distal CpG sites through the mediation effect of proximal CpG sites. We found preliminary evidence that the cis-CpG sites mediating the trans-meQTL associations were enriched for genes involved in methylation regulation such as genes encoding for GTPase or proteins involved in genetic imprinting. GTPase-related gene pathways appear to modulate expression of DNA methyltransferases43. Methylation-induced expression changes of these genes may result in further methylation changes of other genes (i.e. in trans). Moreover a noncoding RNA within the intron of KCNQ1 a key gene regulating genetic imprinting can influence chromatin 3-D structure via a protein complex including DNA methyltransferase proteins4445. These findings suggest intricate mechanisms for trans-regulating effects through proximal methylation. cis-meQTLs may affect cancer risk.\nLabels: [Thyroid_Cancer, Colon_Cancer, Lung_Cancer]\nReply with one label only.", "assistant": "Lung_Cancer"}

The functions f(x) and w(?) composing sx(xt) for the model candidates are selected a priori among linear constant piecewise constant functions and quadratic B-splines with 36 models in total. Specifically the three cut-offs of a piecewise constant function and combinations of 01 or 2 knots for B-splines are placed at quartiles for the dimension of x corresponding to 26.760.2 and 122.2 WLM year and at 13.320 or 26.6 lags for the dimension of ?. Also in alternative parameterizations of w(?) the intercept is excluded in the B-spline bases left-constraining the smooth lag response curve to start from a null risk at lag 2. This a priori assumption reasonably follows the hypothesis that the risk associated with past exposures smoothly increases from zero starting from lag 2. Model selection is based on AIC and BIC adapted to survival analysis given by the following: (12) where is the log-likelihood of the fitted model k is the number of total df and d is the number of uncensored events. The best-fitting model (11) is chosen by minimizing AIC or BIC in (12). Both criteria apply a multiplicative constant to the number of parameters for penalizing more complex models. In particular the penalty of BIC (equal to log(d)) is usually higher and tends to select simpler models. 3.3. Results for distributed lag models Results for simple DLMs assuming a linear radon mortality relationship on the log scale are illustrated first. Table II presents models with different functions w(?) as defined in (3). Specifically model 1 is specified by a constant (intercept only) function producing a lag-basis identical to the traditional index of unweighted cumulative exposure; model 2 is an example of a DLM with a piecewise constant function; the best-fitting B-spline models with and without intercept specified by a single knot at 13.3 lags are reported as models 3 and 4 respectively. The fit of the various options is expressed by AIC and BIC with the best performance achieved by model 1 for both criteria. This model assigns the same importance to the exposures experienced ? lags earlier in defining the risk for a given time. The specification of more flexible functions with more df does not seem to improve the fit.

The figure shows the lag response curves estimated from models 4 (with 95 CI)2 and 1 as specified in Table II. Data from the Colorado Plateau uranium miners cohort. The better performance of model 1 seems to indicate that the hypothesis of constant risk H0 : w(?) c is supported by the data. Also the lag response curve from model 4 in does not suggest a decrease in risk at longer lags although the confidence intervals are relatively wide in this part of the lag period. 3.4. Results for distributed lag non-linear models The results illustrated in Section 3.3 are dependent on the strong assumption of a log-linear relationship between radon exposure and lung cancer mortality. The analysis can be repeated with more flexible DLNMs which can describe simultaneously nonlinear exposure response relationships and lag structures through the specification of a cross-basis in (5) (7). The definition of DLNMs involves a higher number of potential models obtained by different combinations of bases for the functions f(x) and w(?). The second part of Table II only reports models with the same choices for w(?) used in DLM and with f(x) specified as another piecewise constant function and the B-spline providing the best fit with one knot at 60.2 WLM year. Overall the best-fitting option for both AIC and BIC is model 8 with a B-spline for both f(x) and w(?). This model uses 9 df in total for expressing the bidimensional association. The hypothesis H0 : f(x) x of a linear radon-mortality dependency is not supported by the data as all the DLNMs show a substantial decrease in both AIC and BIC when compared with simpler DLMs. In particular the comparison of the best-fitting model 8 representing f w(x?) with model 4 representing x w(x?) indicates that the 6 additional df substantially improve the fit. Similarly the hypothesis H0 : w(?) c of a constant risk along lags previously suggested when evaluating DLMs is not supported either. The comparison of model 8 with model 5 representing f(x) c indicates a better fit of the former. Interestingly this result is the opposite of what was suggested in Section 3.3 revealing how imposing a wrong assumption about the relationship in one dimension induces spurious results in the other space compromising the analysis of the association. The interpretation of results from DLNMs relies on a bidimensional representation of the exposure lag response association. This is achieved by computing the risk contributions over a grid defined in the range of the exposure x and the lag ? applying (9). This bidimensional dependency is depicted in the two top panels of showing the predicted HR surfaces from models 8 and 6 in the range 0 250 WLM and 0 40 lags. The graphs show an initial increase in risk along lags peaking at approximately 10 years after the exposure and then decreasing and apparently disappearing after about 30 years independent of the exposure levels. The inspection of the panels along the dimension of x reveals the nonlinear radon-mortality dependency with the risk increasing steadily up to 50 WLM year and then flattening out. The shape of the HR surfaces unveils the different assumptions underlying the choices of bases for functions f(x) and w(?) namely B-splines and piecewise constant functions. Hazard ratio (HR) of lung cancer mortality associated with radon exposure in the range 0 250 WLM year and lag period 0 40 years. The figure shows 3-D graphs of the exposure lag response association on a grid of exposure lag values (from model 8 top left and model 6 top right) lag response curves for radon exposure of 100 WLM year (from models 8 with 95 CI and model 6 bottom left) and exposure response curves at lag 15 (from models 8 with 95 CI and models 6 and 4 bottom right). The models are described in Table II. Data from the Colorado Plateau uranium miners cohort. Although the 3-D representation offered by the top panels in provides an overview of the bidimensional association it is still limited for inferential purposes as the uncertainty in the estimate is not reported. In order to extend the interpretation the analysis can focus on the risk along ? predicted for specific exposure intensities or alternatively the risk along x for specific lags namely the vectors and from Section 2.3. These dependencies are represented by slices cut on the bidimensional risk surface along the appropriate dimension. The bottom panels of report the lag response curve corresponding to an exposure level of 100 WLM year and the exposure response curve for lag 15 from both Models 8 and 6 together with 95 confidence intervals for the former. These curves correspond to the two bold lines in the 3-D plots. The bottom-left panel is interpreted similarly to the DLM in as the specific risk contributions composing the lag response curve but this time associated with a specific exposure xp 100 WLM year. The curve estimated from model 8 peaks at lag 11 with an HR of 1.21 (95 CI: 1.16 1.26) and both models 8 and 6 suggest that the risk disappears after 30 35 years. The B-spline for w(?) in model 8 is left-constrained by the lack of an intercept forcing the smoothed lag response curve to start from a null risk at lag 2. The best fit of Model 8 if compared with model 7 which includes the intercept seems to support this hypothesis. The bottom-right panel shows instead the risk contributions at ?p 15 for different exposure intensities and is interpreted as the exposure response at t from exposures experienced at t ? 15 (backward perspective) or the exposure response contributions at t 15 from exposures experienced at year t (forward perspective). Although models 8 and 6 adopt different bases for functions f(x) and w(?) the estimates of the predicted risk along x and ? are consistent showing a radon-mortality relationship that is markedly nonlinear and nonconstant in time. These measures of risk are extended in Figure 3 reporting estimates from model 8 for different exposure and lag values. A right-constrained version of Model 8 is discussed in Section D.1 and illustrated in Figure S2 of the supporting information. Figure 3 Hazard ratio (HR) of lung cancer mortality associated with radon exposure in the range 0 250 WLM year and lag period 0 40 years. The figure shows lag response curves for radon exposure of 2050100 and 200 WLM year (left) and exposure response curves at lag 51015 and 20 (right) estimated from model 8 as specified in Table II. Data from the Colorado Plateau uranium miners cohort. Interestingly even though model 8 is produced from the flexible definition in (5) (7) Figures 2 and 3 suggest that the assumption of independency holds here with shapes of the exposure-response and lag-response curves at different values of ?p and xp respectively being proportional and the maximum HR constantly experienced at lag 11. This result reinforces the fact that the cross-basis representation based on a truly bivariate exposure lag response function f w(x?) may appropriately describe the specific independency case defined by the simpler representation f(x) w(?) in (4). 3.5. Prediction for specific exposure histories The flexible modeling approach described here can be applied to predict the overall cumulative risk from (10) for a specific exposure history qh as outlined in Section 2.3. Table III illustrates the predicted HR from four different models in five alternative exposure scenarios. This approach previously proposed 17 provides clear and interpretable risk summaries from complex models in the presence of varying exposure patterns. The first two scenarios refer to a constant radon exposure of 20 and 100 WLM year respectively in the past 10 years. As expected simple DLMs (models 1 and 4) predict a similar risk but substantially lower than the two DLNMs with a B-spline for f(x). In particular model 5 extends model 1 by allowing a nonlinear dependency for the unweighted cumulative exposure estimating a slightly lower risk when compared with the more flexible model 8 already described. The third scenario extends the exposure to 20 WLM year in the previous 20 years while the fourth one assumes that a 10-year exposure to the same intensity ceased 10 years before. The comparative assessment of the four models is similar to the first two examples. The last scenario considers the risk of more remote exposures occurring 30 39 years ago. Interestingly models 1 and 5 provide identical estimates to the fourth scenario as the risk of past exposures is assumed constant along the whole lag period. Model 8 instead predicts no excess in lung cancer in the last scenario given at least 30 years passed from the last exposure to radon a lag period for which the lag response curve in (bottom-left panel) displays a null risk. Table III Overall cumulative hazard ratio (with 95 CI) of lung cancer mortality associated with alternative scenarios of exposure histories to radon as predicted from models 145 and 8 described in Table II Model 1 Model 4 Model 5 Model 8 Exposure scenario x c x w(x?) f(x) c f w(x?) 20 WLM year in the last 10 years 1.05 (1.04 1.06) 1.04 (1.03 1.05) 1.33 (1.22 1.46) 1.52 (1.31 1.76) 100 WLM year in the last 10 years 1.27 (1.22 1.33) 1.20 (1.13 1.27) 1.96 (1.73 2.22) 2.37 (1.87 2.99) 20 WLM year in the last 20 years 1.11 (1.09 1.14) 1.11 (1.09 1.14) 1.92 (1.56 2.35) 3.12 (2.29 4.24) 20 WLM year 10 19 years ago 1.06 (1.05 1.07) 1.07 (1.06 1.09) 1.43 (1.28 1.61) 2.05 (1.70 2.48) 20 WLM year 30 39 years ago 1.06 (1.05 1.07) 1.05 (1.00 1.11) 1.43 (1.28 1.61) 1.04 (0.64 1.70) WLM working-level months. The summaries illustrated in this section can be extended to predict how the risk evolves dynamically in time in association with time-varying exposures. Adopting a forward perspective the risk changes along an exposure profile with specific exposures events referring to different lags and producing a different exposure history. As an example Figure 4 displays the overall cumulative mortality risk within years 0 60 for an exposure to 20 WLM year experienced in the first 15 years. Here model 8 predicts an HR peak of 2.94 (95 CI: 2.20 3.93) at around 20 years 5 years after the end of the exposure. The plot also suggests that model 4 assuming a log-linear exposure response relationship seriously underestimates the risk of lung cancer for four decades predicting an HR at year 20 of 1.11 (95 CI: 1.09 1.13). Also the assumption of a constant risk along lags of a nonlinear relationship adopted in model 5 produces an underestimation of the predicted HR in the first part of the period followed by a clear overestimation in the last years. Figure 4 Trend of hazard ratio (HR) of lung cancer mortality in the period 1 60 years associated with radon exposure of 20 WLM year experienced in years 1 15 predicted from models 8 (with 95 CI)5 and 4 as specified in Table II. 3.6. On linearity and the nonspecial case of log transformation The bottom-right panel of reports the exposure response for the simple DLM in model 4 which predicts a substantially lower risk than the two DLNMs. This difference is also evident when comparing the HR range in Figures 1 and 2 (bottom-left panel). This discrepancy is related to the wrong assumption of a linear radon-mortality dependency with the fit of model 4 highly dependent on a few of very high exposure occurrences. A sensitivity analysis performed on the subset of subjects with a maximum yearly exposure to radon of less than 300 WLM year (81.6 of the total) is illustrated in Section D.2 of the supporting information. The highly skewed distribution of exposure events to radon and the shape of the estimated exposure response curve suggest a log transformation of the exposure. In fact this model can be still described as a DLNM in (5) (7) characterized by a basis with dimension vx 1 corresponding to f(x) log(x 1). A new model is defined by replacing the spline in model 8 with the log function. The comparison is presented in details in Section D.3 of the supporting information. Although this more parsimonious model slightly improves the fit with an AIC of 2148.6 it is worth noting that results are very similar as illustrated in Figure S4 (supporting information) suggesting that the spline function is flexible enough to recover the association. More generally different functions than those presented here can be used to define the exposure response or lag structure. 4. Simulation study The performance of the extended DLNM framework is validated through simulations under different scenarios of exposure lag response associations. Specifically the framework is evaluated by estimating the relative bias coverage and relative root mean square error (RMSE) of the estimators derived from AIC and BIC selection and the empirical rejection rates for the hypotheses H0 : f(x) x and H0 : w(?) c of linearity and constant effects respectively. 4.1. Simulation design and data generation The simulation setting involves the generation of exposure profiles for a set of ns subjects the definition of scenarios with known bidimensional exposure lag response associations and the random generation of time-to-event occurrences from such scenarios. These steps are briefly summarized here with more detailed information provided in Section E of the supporting information. The time-varying exposure profiles for ns subjects are represented as series of occurrences xt at time t 1 100 generated by random exposure events with an intensity in the range 0 10. The exposure lag response associations are defined by the function fs(x) ws(?) in (4) which is simpler to simulate if compared with the truly bivariate alternative in (5) for each value of exposure x and lag ?. Different scenarios explore alternative choices for the exposure response function fs(x) and the lag response function ws(?). These are obtained by simple mathematical functions involving logarithms or exponentials. Specifically fs(x) is specified as linear plateau and exponential while ws(?) as constant decay and peak (see Figure S7 in the supporting information). Three scenarios out of the nine possible combinations are shown in the top panels of Figure 5 the others in Figure S8 (supporting information). Figure 5 Results of the simulation study for three scenarios of exposure lag response associations (linear-constant plateau-decay and exponential-peak in each column). The graphs illustrate the true simulated 3-D exposure lag response association (first row) and the lag response (second third rows) and exposure response curves (fourth fifth rows) from AIC and BIC-selected models corresponding to the bold lines in the 3-D plots. These last panels compare the true simulated associations with the average of the estimated associations together with a sample of estimated curves corresponding to the first 25 simulations (in grey). Results from m 500 simulated data sets with ns 400 subjects. Time-to-event data are simulated conditional on the cumulative contribution of the simulated exposure using a permutational algorithm previously proposed for time-varying exposures 29. The cumulative effect is calculated in the form of a function defined in (4) given the exposure history of each subject at time t over a lag period 0 L with L 40. Censoring events are included and represent approximately 25 of the total. For each of the nine scenarios m 500 data sets are simulated with a number of subjects ns equal to 200400 or 800. 4.2. Evaluation of performance For each data set i 1 500 the exposure lag response association is estimated by Cox regression models with a cross-basis as defined in (5) (7). The Efron method is used for tie handling. Similarly to the example in the exposure response function fe(x) is specified as a simple linear term or quadratic B-splines with 01 or 2 knots placed at 3.35 or 6.7. The lag response function we(?) is specified as a simple constant term with 1 df or quadratic B-splines with intercept and 01 or 2 knots placed at 13.320 or 26.7 lags. The total number of df for the cross-basis function se(xt) ranges from 1 1 1 to 4 5 20 in the 36 models. For each simulated data set the best-fitting models are selected as those minimizing AIC and BIC in (12) respectively. Performance is formally evaluated using a synthetic risk summary ?c from (10) corresponding to an overall cumulative effect and then visually assessed on the whole exposure lag response association.\nLabels: [Thyroid_Cancer, Colon_Cancer, Lung_Cancer]\nReply with one label only.", "assistant": "Lung_Cancer"}

growth of cells in many studies cell culture conditions are not sufficiently detailed which is essential for study replication one possible solution to address the potential effect of serum could be using culture media without fcs so the media does not need to be altered during drug exposition in any case neither higher serum concentrations nor lower serum concentrations represent the proper microenvironment of a cancer cell in the human body and both approaches could be valid to test the effects of a drug on cell lines the tumor microenvironment is enriched with metabolites including lactate and adenosine which increases tumor growth and may modulate the therapeutic effect of a drug in tumors that are highly glycolytic increasing mitochondrial activity as exerted by cbd may add metabolic stress to cells forcing them to decreased growth the effect of a drug on cells can be assessed effectively if the experimental conditions of the treatment are the same as the growing

but to the combination of variableslimitationsour results did not show statistically significant differences with the exception of the assessment of viability of ht29 cells under cbd treatment and the
