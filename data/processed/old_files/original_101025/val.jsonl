There were fewer target lesions in the other three ans than in the lung and there was no association between liver lymph node or kidney lesion size and percent change in post-treatment tumor diameter (). The percent changes in target lesion size differed significantly between the four individual ans (P? ?0.0007 by the Kruskal Wallis test). The mean ( SD) percent changes in target lesion size in the lung liver lymph nodes and kidney were ?27.1? ?33.5 0.5? ?29.4 ?16.7? ?19.6 and ?2.7? ?21.7 respectively. Target lesions in the lung showed the greatest change in size which was significantly greater than in the liver and kidney (P? ?0.007 and 0.002 respectively). There was no difference in the percent change in target lesion size between the lung and lymph nodes (P? ?0.114) (). Association between pre-treatment tumor size and percent change in lesion size after sunitinib treatment. Association between pre-treatment tumor size and percent change in size was analyzed for lesions in the lung (a) liver (b) lymph nodes (c) and kidney (d). The pre-treatment size of lung lesions showed a moderately positive association with percent size change after treatment with sunitinib while no association was observed in the liver lymph nodes and kidney. Percent change in target lesion size in different ans. The reduction in lesion size was significantly greater in lung lesions compared with liver and kidney lesions. Lung lesions with an initial diameter? ?17.3 mm (median) showed a significant percent reduction in size compared with lesions???17.3 mm. No significant differences in relation to initial lesion size were observed in the liver lymph nodes and kidney. Lesions in each an were divided into two groups according to the median pre-treatment diameter and percent changes in tumor diameter were compared between the two groups. Lung lesions with a pre-treatment diameter less than the median value of 17.3 mm showed a significant percent reduction in diameter compared with tumors???17.3 mm (P? ?0.002). There were no differences in the percent change in relation to size above or below the median value in other ans (). Cut-off value for pre-treatment tumor diameter predicting response to sunitinib in lung metastasis ROC curves were drawn to determine cut-off values predicting 30 and 50 reductions in the diameter of lung metastatic lesions (). The cut-off predicting a 30 reduction in diameter was 16.5 mm with a sensitivity of 69.6 specificity of 58.2 and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.662. The cut-off predicting a 50 reduction in diameter was also 16.5 mm with a sensitivity of 67.0 specificity of 77.8 and an AUC of 0.752. Using this cut-off value the percent change in lesion size for lesions? ?16.5 mm was ?41.7? ?35.5 while that for lesions???16.5 mm was ?16.2? ?26.9 (P? ?0.0005). Cut-off values of initial lung tumor size for predicting 30 and 50 reductions in diameter after sunitinib treatment. Based on ROC analysis the cut-off values of initial lung lesion size for predicting reductions in diameter of both 30 and 50 were 16.5 mm. Influence of pre-treatment CRP value cytoreductive nephrectomy and treatment line on percent change in target lesion size in the lung Metastatic lung lesions were categorized into two groups based on pre-treatment C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. The mean diameter and percent change in lesion size in patients with CRP? ?2.0 mg ml were 19.0? ?9.3 mm and ?38.3? ?30.5 respectively while those in patients with CRP???2.0 mg ml were 28.3? ?20.6 mm and ?9.6? ?33.9 respectively. The lesions were further divided into three subgroups according to pre-treatment diameter? ?20 mm ? 20 to? ?40 mm and???40 mm. Percent changes were compared between lesions in patients with CRP? ?2.0 mg dl (low CRP) and those with CRP???2.0 mg dl (high CRP) in each subgroup. For lesions? ?20 mm patients with low CRP had significantly greater reductions in tumor diameter than patients with high CRP (?43.8? ?33.4 vs. ?15.3? ?37.7 P? ?0.0019). In patients with lesions ?20 to? ?40 mm there was a tendency towards a greater reduction in patients with low CRP compared with high CRP though the difference was not significant (?29.0? ?17.3 vs. ?12.4? ?30.2 P? ?0.054) and similarly there was no significant association between tumor reduction and CRP level in patients with lesions???40 mm (?13.3? ?20.6 vs. 6.8? ?17.4 P? ?0.151) (). Influence of CRP on percent change in lung lesion size. In patients with lung lesions? ?20 mm the percent reduction in size was significantly greater in patients with low compared with high CRP levels. Meanwhile CRP level had a marginal effect on size reduction in lesions???20 to? ?40 mm and no effect in lesions???40 mm. Percent changes in size were compared between lung lesions in patients in each diameter subgroup who did and did not undergo cytoreductive nephrectomy. There were no lung lesions???40 mm in patients who did not undergo cytoreductive nephrectomy. There was no significant difference between mean percent change in lesion size in patients with and without cytoreductive nephrectomy (?36.1? ?32.6 vs. ?28.2? ?41.9 P? ?0.421 and ?20.4? ?25.1 vs. ?32.0? ?21.9 P? ?0.307 in lesions? ?20 mm and???20 mm respectively). Similarly there was no significant difference in percent change in lesion size between lung lesions in patients treated as first-line therapy and those treated as second-line or later therapy in any diameter subgroup (?38.1? ?37.7 vs. ?32.1? ?33.9 P? ?0.280; ?23.5? ?21.6 vs. ?17.5? ?23.3 P? ?0.803; and 3.5? ?2.6 vs. 1.9? ?22.9 P? ?0.9 in lesions? ?20 mm ? 20 to? ?40 mm and???40 mm respectively). Discussion A previous study on metastatic RCC by Yuasa et al. demonstrated that: 1) smaller initial tumor size predicted a good response to TKIs; 2) the greatest response was achieved in patients with lung lesions; and 3) there was no difference in tumor response between patients treated with sorafenib and sunitinib 6 .\nLabels: [Thyroid_Cancer, Colon_Cancer, Lung_Cancer]\nReply with one label only.", "assistant": "Lung_Cancer"}

various compounds labeled with 99mtc to was used to reduce its valence state in order to obtain complexes with nanoscale ps25 as a result of the reaction of these components the appearance of an untargeted colloid is also possible due to the hydrolysis of excess sncl2 2h2o or the additional formation of a complex of reduced 99mtc with tin26 all this required preliminary experimental studies to establish the necessary and sufficient amount of sncl2 2h2o in the reaction mixtureduring the experiments it was found that the optimal concentration of sn ii in the composition of the reaction mixture when it interacts with 99mtc should be in the range of a0mgml table a0it was found that when the eluate with the preliminarily reduced 99mtc vii was added to the nanops the sn ii concentration introduced in the rp was csn a0mgml almost the entire amount of 99mtc has time to enter the composition of the largesize complex with tin even before its mixing with nanops this means that the sequence of the introduction and mixing of the reagents has a great influence on the labeling process especially it concerns the introduction of the sn ii solution into the reaction mixture in this connection the reduction of 99mtc with tin ii was carried out in the presence of the selected substance in this case we can observe a competitive redistribution of the radionuclide between the

connection to increase the mobility of the labeled ps and increase the speed of their movement through the lymph system matrix systems based on gelatin provide a fairly uniform distribution of the

BACKGROUND This cooperative group adjuvant phase 2 trial in patients with completely resected stage I non-small cell lung cancer with tumor diameters measuring ??2 cm was designed to assess the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of assigning patients to therapy or observation using a molecularly based decision algorithm. METHODS At least a lobectomy and sampling of recommended mediastinal lymph node stations good Zubrod performance status adequate an function and a formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tumor specimen were required. Excision repair cross-complementing group 1 (ERCC1) and ribonucleotide reductase M1 (RRM1) were analyzed using immunofluorescence-based in situ automated quantitative image analysis and categorized as high or low using prespecified cutoff values. Patients with high ERCC1 and RRM1 were assigned to observation and all others to 4 cycles of cisplatin and gemcitabine. Feasibility was defined as treatment assignment within 84 days from surgery in ?85 of patients. Secondary objectives were to estimate the 2-year survival. RESULTS Treatment assignment met the feasibility criteria in 88 of eligible patients (71 of 81 patients). The collective 2-year disease-free and overall survival rates were 80 and 96 respectively. Protein levels for RRM1 fell within the previously established range ERCC1 levels were slightly lower than expected and they were significantly correlated (correlation coefficient 0.4). The rates of assignment of patients to observation (22 ) and chemotherapy (78 ) were as expected. S Gene expression analysis for treatment assignment is feasible. Survival results are encouraging and require future validation. Real-time performance of quantitative in situ ERCC1 and RRM1 analysis requires further development. lung cancer adjuvant therapy personalized medicine ERCC1 (excision repair cross-complementing group 1) RRM1 (ribonucleotide reductase M1) INTRODUCTION After publication of the International Adjuvant Lung Cancer Trial in 2004 adjuvant chemotherapy containing a platinum agent has become the standard of care for patients with a complete surgical resection of American Joint Committee on Cancer stage II to III (version 6) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).1 The trial included patients with stage I to III disease and demonstrated an absolute 4.1 improvement in overall survival (OS) and a subgroup analysis indicated that the OS benefit increased with stage: the hazards ratio (HR) for death among patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy compared with controls was approximately 0.98 for patients with stage I disease 0.88 for patients with stage II disease and 0.79 for patients with stage III disease.1 The data were confirmed by the National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group JBR.10 trial in 2005 which included patients with stage IB and stage II disease.2 A third trial Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 9633 which included only patients with stage IB disease was terminated early and also reported a therapeutic benefit for adjuvant chemotherapy.3 However a final analysis of mature data revealed no statistically significant OS benefit (HR 0.83) but demonstrated a benefit for patients with tumor diameters of ??4 cm (HR 0.69).4 During the same time period an increasing number of correlative biomarker analyses demonstrated that the efficacy of platinum agents was associated with intratumoral levels of the excision repair cross-complementing group 1 (ERCC1) gene with high levels indicating resistance.5 9 Similarly high intratumoral levels of the regulatory subunit of ribonucleotide reductase M1 (RRM1) were reported to be predictive of resistance to gemcitabine.9 13 Finally both biomarkers had also been reported to be prognostic of survival in patients who had not received chemotherapy or radiation with high levels indicating longer survival.814 16 Based on these data we designed an adjuvant trial in 2007. The underlying hypothesis was that patients with high intratumoral levels of ERCC1 and RRM1 would not benefit from chemotherapy and would have a good prognosis because of a less aggressive tumor phenotype. In contrast patients with low levels of ERCC1 and RRM1 would have tumors that were sensitive to chemotherapy but with a more aggressive phenotype. Because a biomarker-driven adjuvant chemotherapy selection trial had not been performed in patients with NSCLC we focused on demonstrating the feasibility of such an approach before launching a phase 3 trial. In addition because adjuvant chemotherapy had quickly become the standard of care for patients with stage II IIIA disease we focused our efforts on patients with stage I disease. After discussions within the SWOG (formerly the Southwest Oncology Group) lung cancer working group and the National Cancer Institute (NCI)'s Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program and after peer review by a National Institutes of Health study section the consensus was to focus this feasibility trial on patients with stage I disease and tumor diameters of ?2 cm. MATERIALS AND METHODS Trial Design and Treatment Plan The trial (NCT00792701 SWOG-0720) complied with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the study institutions. Eligibility criteria included a diagnosis of NSCLC; stage I disease (according to version 6 of the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging manual) with a tumor diameter ??2?cm; a complete surgical resection by lobectomy bilobectomy or pneumonectomy; surgical staging of the mediastinum through sampling of at least 2 lymph node stations; a positron emission tomography scan; a computed tomographic scan of the chest and abdomen; adequate bone marrow liver and renal function; a Zubrod performance status of 0 or 1; and willingness to provide a smoking history. Patients with a prior malignancy prior radiation to the chest or other significant illnesses according to good medical practice were excluded. Patients had to be registered on the trial within 35 days of surgery. Tumor specimens were then retrieved and shipped to a central laboratory. They were analyzed for in situ tumor levels of ERCC1 and RRM1 using an immunofluorescence-based automated quantitative analysis method.17 Prespecified cutoff levels that had been determined in 187 patients with stage I disease (??65 for ERCC1 and ??40 for RRM1) were used to categorize specimens as high or low expressors for each marker (Fig. 1).16 The appropriate therapeutic assignment was then passed on to the statistical center and the participating therapeutic center; however specific protein levels were not communicated to the treatment center. Therapeutic assignment was based solely on biomarker categories and no other stratification parameters were used. Figure 1 CONSORT (Consolidated Standards Of Reporting Trials) diagram of the trial is shown. Patients with high levels of both biomarkers received active surveillance and patients with low levels of one or both biomarkers received 4 cycles of cisplatin (at a dose of 80 mg m2 on day 1) and gemcitabine (at a dose of 1 g m2 on days 1 and 8) every 21 days. The protocol included provisions for dose reductions or treatment delays. The addition of other targeted or cytotoxic agents during therapy or as maintenance was not permitted. Specimen Collection Processing and Gene Expression Analysis The study required the collection and shipment of formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tumor blocks before therapy. However if local policies did not permit submission of a tissue block 10 serial unstained sections could be submitted. Processing was done in a reference laboratory by 1 of 2 investigators (V.O. and Z.Z.). Sections measuring 5 ?m in thickness were placed on frosted glass slides and in situ quantification was performed by the automated quantitative analysis method (PM-2000 version 1 HistoRx Inc New Haven CT) as previously described.91618 The primary antibody for the detection of ERCC1 was clone 8F1 (product code NB500-704 lots G412 and H347 from Novus Biologicals Littleton Colo ) and the antiserum for RRM1 was R1AS-6 (generated in a rabbit in 2003 against a keyhole limpet hemocyanin KLH -conjugated 21-aminoacid peptide specific to the N-terminal of RRM1 column purification lot 09-2008). Slides were scanned with SpotGrabber (HistoRx New Haven Conn.) and image data were captured with a digital camera and fluorescence microscope and analyzed. Scores were adjusted to range from 1 to 255. Because full sections were evaluated for each specimen multiple spots with diameters of 0.6 mm were analyzed to obtain a representative level of protein expression. The number of spots was dependent on suitable areas with tumor cells and it ranged from 5 to 25 spots (median 10 spots) for both targets. Runs included a tissue microarray of 15 control specimens in triplicate for control purposes. Statistical Analysis The primary objective of the current study was the feasibility of a biomarker-based treatment assignment in the cooperative group setting. If the true success rate were ??75 then a biomarker-based treatment assignment would not be considered feasible but if the true success rate were ??90 it would be feasible. If ??47 of 55 eligible patients (85 ) were successfully assigned to treatment or active monitoring within 84 days from surgery this would be considered evidence of feasibility. The design had 91 power using an exact binomial test with a 1-sided type I error of 5 . Secondary objectives included estimating the collective 2-year disease-free survival (DFS) for patients who accepted their treatment assignment and in the subset of patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy. However there would be no comparison made between treatment arms. To assess DFS the disease status was monitored every 2 months for the first 6 months and subsequently every 3 months by computed tomography after enrollment and according to good medical practice. Toxicities related to the administration of chemotherapy were assessed according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 3.0; ctep.cancer.gov). DFS was defined as the time from the date of enrollment to disease recurrence or death due to any cause and estimated according to the Kaplan-Meier method. A Cox regression model was fit with the time from surgery to enrollment as a covariate to evaluate its effect on DFS. A natural log transformation was applied to the raw protein measurement data and the Pearson correlation coefficient was used to test associations. Bivariate comparison of baseline characteristics between the assigned treatment groups was performed using the Fisher exact test for categorical variables or the Student t test or Wilcoxon rank sum test for continuous variables. A multivariable logistic model to evaluate baseline factors and treatment assignment was fit using backwards selection. Median ERCC1 and RRM1 expression levels were compared with historical medians using the 1-sample Wilcoxon signed rank test. The percentage of patients with both ERCC1 ??65 and RRM1 ??40 was compared with the historical rate using a chi-square test. All statistical analyses and graphics were performed using SAS statistical software (version 9.2; SAS Institute Inc Cary NC). A significance level of 5 was used for all analyses. RESULTS Patient and Trial Characteristics To ensure an adequate sample size of eligible patients and biomarker-specific subgroups a total of 85 patients was registered between April 2 2009 and April 1 2011 from 27 participating sites. Four patients were ineligible; 3 had inadequate lymph node sampling and 1 did not have a tumor measuring ??2 cm. Table 1 provides the characteristics of the 81 eligible patients.

The distribution of assignment to chemotherapy and observation was 63 patients (78 ) and 18 patients (22 ) respectively which was not significantly different (P? ?.20 Fisher exact test) from the expected rates of 70 (129 patients) and 30 (55 patients) respectively.16 Based on protein levels in these 81 patients the number of those with low ERCC1 and low RRM1 was 31 patients (38 ) 22 patients had low ERCC1 and high RRM1 (27 ) 10 patients had high ERCC1 and low RRM1 (12 ) and 18 patients had high ERCC1 and RRM1 (22 ) which is not significantly different from prior results (P? ?.14 Fisher exact test; 54 of 184 29 ; 38 of 184 21 ; 37 of 184 20 ; and 55 of 1840.3 respectively). We investigated whether treatment arm assignment varied by patients' smoking status histology age and sex. In bivariate comparisons no statistically significant associations were found. However the multivariable logistic model found that patients with adenocarcinoma (P? ?.03) and potentially stage IA disease (P? ?.06) were more likely to be assigned to adjuvant chemotherapy (ie they were more likely to have low levels of ERCC1 RRM1 or both). One of the 18 patients assigned to observation and 19 of the 63 patients assigned to chemotherapy rejected this choice and withdrew consent. There was no statistically significant difference in patient characteristics between those who accepted and those who refused their treatment assignment (Table 1). Feasibility The trial achieved its primary feasibility objective with a treatment assignment within the prespecified timeframe in 71 of 81 patients (88 ). We successfully determined protein levels in all 85 patients. Ten of the 81 eligible patients did not achieve assignment to treatment versus observation within the 84-day time interval from surgical resection. The time interval from surgery to assignment ranged from 86 days to 105 days in these 10 patients. For 3 patients the specimens were received after the 84-day limit had passed. For the other 7 patients the time interval from receipt to reporting ranged from 7 days to 25 days (median 18 days). For the 71 patients with a successful assignment within the 84-day time interval from surgical resection the time from receipt to reporting ranged from 3 days to 26 days (median 8 days). The reasons for reporting results in excess of 14 days were equipment failure and inadequate expression values in control specimens which required equipment recalibration and a repeat processing of the specimens. Overall the time from receipt of specimens to reporting ranged from 1 day to 27 days (median 11 days; mean 12 days) which is similar to that reported for patients with advanced NSCLC (range 1 day-47 days; median 11 days; mean 12 days).18 Survival and Toxicity Survival analyses were performed on the 61 patients who accepted assignment to treatment (44 patients) or surveillance (17 patients). Patients who rejected their treatment assignment withdrew consent and thus could not be followed for survival. Fourteen patients had DFS events; 2 had died (1 from disease recurrence and the other from cardiac disease without recurrence). The median follow-up among those patients still alive at the time of last follow-up was 27 months (range 3 months-44 months). Six patients had ?24 months of follow-up. The collective 2-year DFS and OS rates were 80 (95 confidence interval 95 CI 67 -88 ) (Fig. 2A) and 96 (95 CI 87 -99 ) from the date of registration. The 2-year DFS rate was 83 (95 CI 68 -92 ) for patients who received chemotherapy (Fig. 2B) and it was 71 (95 CI 43 -87 ) for those observed (Fig. 2C). Table 2 includes 2-year DFS estimates within each of the 3 gene expression categories in the chemotherapy arm. The median time from surgery to enrollment was 41 days (range 11 days-79 days). The time from surgery was added as a covariate to a Cox regression model and was not found to be significantly related to DFS (P? ?.22) or OS (P? ?.36).

In Situ ERCC1 and RRM1 Protein Levels RRM1 levels ranged from 2.4 to 234.3 (median 39.7; mean 48.1) which were not significantly different from the expected values (median 40.5; range 8.3-96.2) (P? ?.87).16 ERCC1 protein levels ranged from 4.3 to 211.2 (median 41.9; mean 58.8) and these values were significantly different from the expected values (median 65.9; range 1.9-178.7) (P? ? 0.02). There was a significant correlation noted between ERCC1 and RRM1 levels (correlation coefficient 0.39; P? ?.0003) (Fig. 3) as previously reported.91618 Figure 3 Distribution of excision repair cross-complementing group 1 (ERCC1) and ribonucleotide reductase M1 (RRM1) levels in eligible patients is shown. The median protein levels of ERCC1 in adenocarcinomas squamous cell carcinomas and the other histologies were 34.257.1 and 121.5 respectively. The corresponding median levels of RRM1 were 38.142.6 and 48.9 respectively. Although the levels were higher in squamous cell carcinomas compared with adenocarcinomas the medians were not statistically significant (ERCC1: P? ?.16; RRM1: P? ?.72). DISCUSSION Disease stage is a predictor of benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with NSCLC. Patients with stage III disease derive the most benefit and those with stage I are reported to derive the least.12419 23 Although not statistically significant for patients with stage I disease and a tumor diameter ?3 cm a numerical risk reduction of 7 has been reported and for those with tumors measuring ??3 cm a numerical risk increase of 40 has been reported.23 A significant treatment-related toxicity is febrile neutropenia which has been reported in 7 to 24 of patients.242022 Treatment-related deaths occur in 0.5 to 2 of patients.122022 The inclusion of molecular markers predictive of therapeutic efficacy into adjuvant decision algorithms would greatly improve the clinical benefit and reduce toxicity for patients with NSCLC. This approach is particularly attractive for patients with stage I disease in whom the parameters for weighing risks and benefits are to our knowledge the least well defined. Recent advances in molecular diagnostics have resulted in improved outcomes for patients whose tumors harbor mutations in oncogenic signal transduction molecules that can be inactivated by therapeutic agents. Similarly platinum agents target DNA and gemcitabine targets ribonucleotide reductase; both are unequivocally required not only for cellular proliferation but also for other essential cellular functions. Although to our knowledge specific oncogenic mutations have not been identified to date ERCC1 and RRM1 have emerged as promising predictors of efficacy for cisplatin and gemcitabine respectively. We conducted a phase 2 trial of treatment selection based on the levels of protein expression of ERCC1 and RRM1 for patients with completely resected stage I NSCLC and tumor diameters ??2 cm primarily to establish feasibility but also to evaluate preliminary efficacy as assessed by 2-year survival rates. We achieved our primary goal by demonstrating within a cooperative group environment that treatment assignment can be achieved for ?85 of patients within 84 days (12 weeks) the established timeframe for the initiation of adjuvant therapy from surgery in patients with NSCLC.12420 22 At first glance our demonstration of feasibility should not be surprising.

required inthis kind of surgery thus based on these results rsbcould meet the need for analgesia in these patientsin addition for a long time epidural analgesia eawas thought to be an effective method for abdominalsurgery studies have proved that epidural analgesia could maintain a good analgesic effect and reduceperioperative opioid consumption including in this typeof surgery however the safety

{"system": "You are a medical text classifier. Choose exactly one label.", "user": "Text: Dye-bias equalization used a global scaling factor computed from the ratio of the average red and green fluorescing normalization control probes. Both methods were conducted using the methylumi package in Bioconductor version 2.11. For each probe DNA methylation level is summarized as a ?-value estimated as the fraction of signal intensity obtained from the methylated beads over the total signal intensity. Probes with detection P-values of 0.05 were considered not significantly different from background noise and were labeled as missing. Methylation probes were excluded from meQTL analysis if any of the following criteria was met: on X Y chromosome annotated in repetitive genomic regions annotated to harbor SNPs missing rate 5 . Because the ?-values for the 65 SNP probes are expected to be similar in matched pair of normal and tumor tissues we performed principal component analysis (PCA) using these 65 SNP probes to confirm the labeled pairs. We then performed PCA using the 5000 most variable methylation probes with var 0.02 and found that the normal tissues were clustered together and well separated from the tumor tissues. We further excluded 5 normal tissues that were relatively close to the tumor cluster. From the remaining 239 normal tissue samples we analyzed 210 with genotype data from a previous GWAS of lung cancer20. Genotype data and genetic association analysis The blood samples were genotyped using the Illumina HumanHap550K SNP arrays in EAGLE GWAS20. The SNPs with call rate 99 minor allele frequency (MAF) 3 and Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) P-value 10?5 were included for analysis. Prior to meQTL analysis each methylation trait was regressed against sex age batches and PCA scores based on methylation profiles. The regression residues were then quantile-normalized to the standard normal distribution N(01) as traits. The genetic association testing was performed using PLINK and R adjusted for the top three PCA scores based on GWAS SNPs to control for potential population stratification. Identification of cis-meQTLs For each CpG methylation probe the cis region was defined as being less than 500kb upstream and downstream from the target CpG-site (1Mb total). A methylation trait was detected to harbor a cis-meQTL if any SNP in the cis region had a SNP-CpG nominal association P-value less than P0 where P0 was chosen to control FDR at 5 by permutations. Here we describe a permutation procedure to choose P0 to control FDR at 5 . For a given P0 let N(P0) be the total number of CpG probes with detected cis-meQTLs and N0(P0) the expected number of CpG probes falsely determined to have cis-meQTLs. FDR is defined as N0(P0) N(P0). The key is to estimate N0(P0) under the global null hypothesis that no CpG probe has cis-meQTLs. We randomly permuted the genotypes across subjects for 100 times keeping the correlation structure of the 338456 methylation traits in each permutation. Then N0(P0) was estimated as the average number of methylation traits that were detected to harbor cis-meQTL SNPs with nominal P P0. Control FDR at 5 requires P0 4.0 10?5. The same procedure was applied to detect secondary independently associated cis-meQTL SNPs. With our sample size h2 0.12 is required to detect cis-meQTLs with power greater than 0.8. We note that although we excluded all CpG probes annotated with SNPs there is still the possibility that rare not annotated variants could be associated with the cis-meQTL SNPs. However since common variants and rare variants are known to be poorly correlated and rare variants are uncommon by definition we do not expect this event to be frequent. Identification of trans-meQTLs For each CpG probe the trans region was defined as being more than 500kb from the target CpG-site in the same chromosome or on different chromosomes. For the kth methylation trait with m SNPs in the trans region let (qk1?qkm) be the P-values for testing the marginal association between the trait and the m SNPs. Let pk min(qk1?qkm) be the minimum P-value for m SNPs and converted pk into genome-wide P-value Pk by performing one million permutations for SNPs in the trans region. Because a cis region is very short ( 1M) compared to the whole genome ( 3000M) Pk computed based on SNPs in trans regions is very close to that based on permutations using genome-wide SNPs. Thus we use the genome-wide p-value computed based on all SNPs to approximate Pk. Furthermore all quantile-normalized traits follow the same standard normal distribution N(01); thus the permutation-based null distributions are the same for all traits. We then applied the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to (P1?PN) to identify trans-meQTLs by controlling FDR at 5 . With our sample size h2 0.24 is required to detect trans-meQTLs with power greater than 0.8. Replication of meQTLs in TCGA samples The replication was performed in TCGA histologically normal tissue samples that had genome-wide genotype (Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0) and methylation profiling (Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip). We downloaded genotype (level 2) and methylation data (level 3) from the TCGA website22. We also downloaded methylation data for tumor tissue samples and performed PCA analysis to confirm that normal tissue samples were separated from tumor tissue samples. Autosomal SNPs with MAF 3 calling rate 0.99 and HWE P-value 10?5 were included for imputation using IMPUTE259 and reference haplotypes in the 1000 Genome Project60 (version 2012 03). We only included samples of European ancestry based on EIGENSTRAT analysis. The replication set had 65 lung 87 breast and 142 kidney histologically normal tissue samples after QC. Again each methylation trait was regressed against sex age batches and PCA scores based on methylation profiles. The regression residues were then quantile-normalized to the standard normal distribution N(01) as traits for meQTL analysis. The associations were tested between the quantile-normalized methylation traits and imputed genotypic dosages adjusting for sex age and PCA scores based on SNPs. A genetic association detected in EAGLE lung data was considered replicated if the association had the same direction and FDR 0.05 based on single-sided P-values. Testing genetic associations with methylation and gene expression traits We downloaded gene expression data (level 3) from RNA-seq analysis of 59 histologically normal tissue samples from NSCL patients from TCGA. All samples also had genome-wide genotype data and 28 samples had additional methylation data from Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChips.\nLabels: [Thyroid_Cancer, Colon_Cancer, Lung_Cancer]\nReply with one label only.", "assistant": "Lung_Cancer"}

All rights reserved. 2014 AIM To revisit the presumed relationship between tumour diameter and volume in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients and determine whether the measured volume using volume-analysis software and its proportional changes during therapy matches with the calculated volume obtained from the presumed relationship and results in concordant response assessment. MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty-three patients with stage IIIB IV NSCLC with a total of 53 measurable lung lesions treated in a phase II trial of erlotinib were studied with institutional review board approval. Tumour volume and diameter were measured at baseline and at the first follow-up computed tomography (CT) examination using volume-analysis software. Using the measured diameter (2r) and the equation calculated volume was obtained as (4 3) ?r3 at baseline and at the follow-up. Percent volume change was obtained by comparing to baseline for measured and calculated volumes and response assessment was assigned. RESULTS The measured volume was significantly smaller than the calculated volume at baseline (median 11488.9 mm3 versus 17148.6 mm3; p 0.0001) with a concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) of 0.7022. At follow-up the measured volume was once again significantly smaller than the calculated volume (median 6573.5 mm3 versus 9198.1 mm3; p 0.0022) with a CCC of 0.7408. Response assessment by calculated versus measured volume changes had only moderate agreement (weighted ? 0.545) with discordant assessment results in 20 (8 40) of lesions. Calculated volume based on the presumed relationship significantly differed from the measured volume in advanced NSCLC patients with only moderate concordance in response assessment indicating the limitations of presumed relationship.

However the function of p38 activation in tumor metastasis is still not well understood. We report that p38 activation in breast cancer cells inhibits tumor metastasis but does not substantially modulate primary tumor growth. Stable p38 knockdown in breast cancer cells suppressed NF-?B p65 activation inhibiting miR-365 expression and resulting in increased IL-6 secretion. The inhibitory effect of p38 signaling on metastasis was mediated by suppression of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) migration to the primary tumor and sites of metastasis where MSCs can differentiate into cancer-associated fibroblasts to promote tumor metastasis. The migration of MSCs to these sites relies on CXCR4-SDF1 signaling in the tumor microenvironment. Analysis of human primary and metastatic breast cancer tumors showed that p38 activation was inversely associated with IL-6 and vimentin expression. This study suggests that combination analysis of p38 MAPK and IL-6 signaling in patients with breast cancer may improve prognosis and treatment of metastatic breast cancer. p38 MAPK Breast cancer Metastasis microRNA IL-6 J Mol Diagn J Mol Diagn The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics : JMD 1525-1578 1943-7811 American Society for Investigative Pathology 24813172 4078366 S1525-1578(14)00074-9 10.1016 j.jmoldx.2014.03.006 Regular Detection of Gene Rearrangements in Targeted Clinical Next-Generation Sequencing Abel Haley J. ?

{"system": "You are a medical text classifier. Choose exactly one label.", "user": "Text: This may be the reason why this pathway is universally aberrant in all the LUAD samples we assessed. Our analysis of this pathway in other cancer types demonstrated less of a role for this pathway suggesting that it is more LUAD specific. We believe that the common disruption of this pathway is a novel discovery as this pathway consisting of 17 genes has not been reported as an indicator of LUAD in any of the studies we acquired datasets from (GSE10082 GSE7670 GSE10072) nor in a literature search with key words.4 SWe have proposed personalized extensions to ORA- and FCS-based pathway analysis by introducing the concept of comparing an individual tumor with many normal samples. Exploratory analyses of our methods with previously published survival pathway signatures reproduced the correct survival outcomes. We have also demonstrated that using nRef improves the validation rate. Unbiased clustering with iPASs revealed sample clustering which is indicative of the cancer differentiation status of LUAD and of different survival outcomes. Clustering also identifies pathway characteristics from patients displaying common up- or downregulations and subgroup-specific deregulations.Pathways that are commonly deregulated across all cancer patients may be useful in identifying cancer from unknown samples. We explored the pathway-based identification of cancer with amino acid synthesis and interconversion and transamination pathway which is commonly upregulated in LUAD patients. Validation using independent datasets demonstrated that this pathway is useful in classifying LUAD and normal lung samples.Based on our results we conclude that individualized pathway scores using nRef can provide a sensitive measure of a patient s clinical features and can be useful for identifying cancer.In our empirical study Average Z performed best in highlighting pathway aberrance and in further revealing clinical importance. It had the best statistical power when identifying a previously known survival-related pathway and the best averaged validation rate for LUAD and colon cancer. In the pathway-based identification of cancer the Mahalanobis method performed best.An important clinical aspect of our methods is that it enables the interpretation of a cancer case in a single patient even if matched normal tissue data from the same individual are unavailable. Accumulated information of normal tissues from a data repository will take the place of data unavailable for a specific individual. As the data repository is growing rapidly it is expected that more nRef data will be available for many diseases in the near future. We hope that our proposed approach can help in the personalized interpretation of tumor data and can be a useful tool in the upcoming era of data-based personalized medicine.Although we have shown our results in microarray platform our method is applicable to different RNA expression platforms including next-generation sequencer. Our method is also supportive of various pathway resources such as KEGG NCI cancer pathway and Biocarta provided in the gmt format. The R code for our methods along with nRefs of LUAD and colon cancer used in our study is available at http: bibs.snu.ac.kr ipas.

Vimentin IF proteins have been implicated in many aspects of cancer initiation and progression including tumorigenesis epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the metastatic spread of cancer. Specifically vimentin IFs have been recognized as an essential component regulating EMT major signal transduction pathways involved in EMT and tumor progression cell migration and invasion the positioning and anchorage of organelles such as mitochondria and cell cell and cell substrate adhesion. In tumorgenesis vimentin forms a complex with 14-3-3 and beclin 1 to inhibit autophagy via an AKT-dependent mechanism. Vimentin is a canonical marker of EMT and recent evidence has shown it to be an important regulator of cellular motility. Transcriptional regulation of vimentin through hypoxia-inducible factor-1 may be a potential driver of EMT. Finally vimentin regulates 14-3-3 complexes and controls various intracellular signaling and cell cycle control pathways by depleting the availability of free 14-3-3. There are many exciting advances in our understanding of the complex role of vimentin IFs in cancer pointing to the key role vimentin IFs may play in tumor progression.

The CDKN2A locus which houses the INK4a and ARF tumor suppressor genes is frequently altered in NSCLC. However the specific role of ARF in pulmonary tumorigenesis remains unclear. KRAS and other oncogenes induce the expression of ARF thus stabilizing p53 activity and arresting cell proliferation. To address the role of ARF in Kras-driven NSCLC we compared the susceptibility of NIH Ola strain wild-type and Arf knockout mice to urethane-induced lung carcinogenesis. Lung tumor size malignancy and associated morbidity were significantly increased in Arf? ? compared to Arf animals at 25 weeks post-induction. Pulmonary tumors from Arf knockout mice exhibited increased cell proliferation and DNA damage compared to wild-type. A subgroup of tumors in Arf? ? animals presented as dedifferentiated and metastatic with many characteristics of pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinoma a neoplasm previously undocumented in mouse models. Our finding of a role for ARF in NSCLC is consistent with the observation that benign adenomas from Arf mice robustly expressed ARF while ARF expression was markedly reduced in malignant adenocarcinomas. ARF expression also frequently co-localized with expression of p21CIP1 a transcriptional target of p53 arguing that ARF induces the p53 checkpoint to arrest cell proliferation in vivo. Together these findings demonstrate that induction of ARF is an early response in lung tumorigenesis that mounts a strong barrier against tumor growth and malignant progression. p19Arf p14ARF ethyl carbamate metastasis J Transl Med J Transl Med Journal of Translational Medicine 1479-5876 BioMed Central 24726028 3996904 1479-5876-12-98 10.1186 1479-5876-12-98 Research Thymidylate synthase polymorphisms in genomic DNA as clinical outcome predictors in a European population of advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients receiving pemetrexed ArÃ valo EstefanÃ a 1 e.arevalo-vazquez hotmail.com CastaÃ Ã³n Eduardo 1 ecastanon unav.es LÃ³pez InÃ s 2 milopez unav.es Salgado Josefa 3 jsalgadog unav.es Collado VÃ ctor 2 v.d.collado gmail.com Santisteban Marta 1 msantisteb unav.es RodrÃ guez-Ruiz MarÃ a 4 mrruiz unav.es MartÃ n Patricia 1 pmromano unav.es Zubiri Leire 4 lzubiri unav.es PatiÃ o-GarcÃ a Ana 3 apatigar unav.es Rolfo Christian 5 christian.rolfo uza.be Gil-Bazo Ignacio 1 2 igbazo unav.es 1Department of Oncology ClÃ nica Universidad de Navarra 31008 Pamplona Spain 2Division of Oncology Center for Applied Medical Research (CIMA) 31008 Pamplona Spain 3Laboratory of Clinical Genetics ClÃ nica Universidad de Navarra 31008 Pamplona Spain 4Department of Radiation Oncology ClÃ nica Universidad de Navarra 31008 Pamplona Spain 5Oncology Department Antwerp University Hospital UZA 2650 Edegem Belgium 2014 14 4 2014 12 98 98 3 11 2013 7 4 2014 Copyright 2014 ArÃ valo et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. 2014 ArÃ valo et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Background We studied whether thymidylate synthase (TS) genotype has an independent prognostic predictive impact on a European population of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients receiving pemetrexed. Methods Twenty-five patients treated with pemetrexed-based regimens were included. Genomic DNA was isolated prior to treatment. The variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphisms the G ?C single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and the TS 6-bp insertion deletion (6 6) in the 3? untranslated region (UTR) polymorphisms were analyzed and correlated with overall response rate (ORR) progression-free survival (PFS) overall-survival (OS) and toxicity. Results The genotype 6 6 predicted a higher ORR among active former smokers compared to 6 -6 genotype (100 vs. 50 ; p ?0.085). Overall the 3R 3R genotype predicted a higher ORR (100 ) over the rest VNTR polymorphisms (p ?0.055). The presence of 3R 3R genotype significantly correlated with a superior ORR in patients without EGFR activating mutations (100 ) compared to 2R 2R 2R 3R and 3R 4R genotype (77.8 33.3 and 0 respectively; p ?0.017). After a median follow-up of 21 months a trend towards a better PFS although not significant was found among subjects showing 3R 3R polymorphisms (p ?0.089). A significantly superior OS was found in patients showing 3R 3R genotype rather than other VNTR polymorphisms (p ?0.019). No significant correlation with the toxicity was observed. Conclusion In our series 3R 3R polymorphism correlated with a superior OS. Also this polymorphism when associated to wild type EGFR was related to a higher ORR to pemetrexed. Toxicity was not significantly correlated with a specific TS genotype. Thymidylate synthase Polymorphisms Epidermal growth factor receptor Predictive factors Prognostic factors Non-small cell lung cancer Background Lung cancer represents the most frequent cause of cancer deaths. More than 225000 new cases were diagnosed during 2012 only in the United States of America accounting for approximately 160000 annual deaths 12 . More than 50 of the patients diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) present advanced disease (stage III and IV) at onset. The most common histology is adenocarcinoma representing approximately 80 of all cases 3 . Pemetrexed is a multitargeted antifolate drug and one of the latest active drugs against NSCLC 4 approved for the first-line 5 (in combination with cisplatin) 6 and second-line treatment (monotherapy) of patients with non-squamous histology 7 . More recently pemetrexed gained approval for its use as a single-agent maintenance therapy 8 after response stabilization to four cycles of a platinum doublet with or without pemetrexed. Thymidylate synthase (TS) is the main biological target of antifolate drugs such as pemetrexed or 5-fluorouracil. Different studies have evaluated the correlation between tumor TS expression and TS genotype and the prognosis of patients with different cancer types treated with antifolates 9-11 . In NSCLC constitutive expression of TS is lower in tumors with adenocarcinoma histology than among those with squamous differentiation 12 . This finding could possibly explain the higher efficacy of the drug among non-squamous histology patients. The potential predictive role of TS polymorphisms in NSCLC has never been studied in a European population. In addition how differential TS genotypes may impact on the outcome of patients depending on their smoking status or with Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) activating mutations tumors is to be determined. Finally although the toxicity profile described in most patients receiving pemetrexed in combination or as a single agent is usually favorable there are several reported cases of fundamentally dermatological hematological and potentially serious renal toxicities even when the recommended vitamin prophylaxis guidelines have been followed 13-15 .\nLabels: [Thyroid_Cancer, Colon_Cancer, Lung_Cancer]\nReply with one label only.", "assistant": "Lung_Cancer"}

discussionby using the wellrecognized cell surface markers of cd44and cd133 for csc identiï cation we tried to separate thehct8 human colon cancer cells into cd44 cd44 cd44cd133 and cd44cd133 subpopulations and then investigated how the expressions of cd44 and cd133 associatedwith drug resistance actually we checked several cancer celllines on the expression of cd44 and cd133 including helacells and a549 cells however both hela cells and a549 cellsshowed almost expression of cd44 only the hct8cells showed a partial expression of cd44 about anda rare expression of cd133 therefore we only isolateddiï erent subpopulations from hct8 cells for this studyfirst we found that the expression level of cd44 keptvery stable in the cd44cd133 cells but gradually declinedin cd44cd133 cells during a cell passaging process on theother hand some of cd44 cells shifted to express cd44 during a cell passaging process figure 1c these ï ndings suggested the plasticity of cd44 expression in hct8 cellsactually ohata et al reported that cd44 highexpressedcells from human intractable colon cancer patients can diï erentiate into cd44 lowexpressed cells and a fraction of cd44lowexpressed cells can also generate cd44 highexpressedcells in a xenograft mouse model however it is unclearwhy the cd44cd133 cells but not cd44cd133 cellsstably maintain the expression level of cd44 unlike theextensive expression of cd44 with high plasticity the expression of cd133 was only observed in very few of the hct8cells with poor plasticitya number of previous studies have demonstrated thatcscs are likely resistant to chemotherapeutic drugs thecd44cd133 cells but not the cd44 and cd44cd133cells showed dxr resistance figure 2a according to thisdata the expression of cd133 but not cd44 seems to beclosely associated with drug resistance actuallythesecd44cd133 cells showed the enhanced expression ofabcb1 and the decreased intracellular accumulation ofdxr figures 2b and 2c liu et al reported that nonsmallcell lung cancer cells treated with lowdose cddp aresuï cient to enrich cd133 cells and upregulate abcb1expression through notch signaling which thereforeincreases the crossresistance to dxr however theinhibition of abcb1 by verapamil only partially improvedthe dxr resistance of cd44cd133 cells in this studyto ï nd other potential mechanisms involving in thedxr resistance of cd44cd133 cells we investigatedseveral interesting aspects including the stress protectionand redox regulation we found that p38mapk one of themost popular protein kinases known to be activated byinï ammatory cytokines lipopolysaccharide osmotic shockultraviolet light and other stresses was more obviouslyinduced by dxr in cd44cd133 cells than cd44cd133cells figure moreover the activation of p38 mapk wasnot dependent on the intracellular accumulation of dxrfigure dxr is known to insert between the base pairs of dna oftumor cells and exhibits antitumor eï ects by suppressing thebiosynthesis of both dna and rna through the inhibitionof dna polymerase rna polymerase and topoisomeraseii reactions furthermore it is believed that dxr has theability to generate suï cient ros to raise oxidative stressindeed we observed dxrinduced ros generation in bothcd44cd133 and cd44cd133 cells butthe dxrinduced ros generation was detected even higher in cd44cd133 than cd44cd133 cells independent on the intracellular accumulation of dxr figures 5a 2b and 3bsuggesting the enhanced antioxidant capacity in cd44cd133 cellsthe keap1nrf2 control system plays a central role in theantioxidant defense mechanisms nrf2 is known as a transcription factor to activate various genes involving in biological defense mechanisms it has been reported that nrf2 isconstantly expressed in many cancer cells moreover the enhanced expression of nrf2 has been conï rmedto associate with poor prognosis of cancer patients in our study nrf2 expression was detected higher in cd44cd133 than cd44cd133 cells and the diï erence in nrf2expression was observed even clearer between cells with dxradministrationindependent on the dxr accumulationfigure 5b these ï ndings also clearly indicate theenhanced antioxidant capacity in cd44cd133 cellsalthough the absence of direct evidence by interferenceexperiment pathways involving in the stress protection andredox regulation might at least partially contributed to thedxr resistance of cd44cd133 cellsvery strangely our data showed that the silencing ofcd133 expression in cd44cd133 cells by sirna couldonly partially increase the cytotoxicity of dxr figure 6bbut

Efficiency of knockdown in CL1-1 and CL1-5 cells was demonstrated for RNA expression by RT-PCR (A) and realtime-PCR (Figure S7) and for protein expression by western blotting (B and C) showing that NQO1 siRNA significantly downregulated NQO1 expression. As shown in D NQO1 siRNA transfection significantly inhibited the increase in NQO1 enzyme activity induced in CL1-1 cells by incubation for 6 or 24 h with 100 or 250 µM sulindac (left panel) sulindac sulfone (center panel) or sulindac sulfide (right panel). When cells transfected for 24 h with siNQO1 or control siRNA were pretreated for 6 h with sulindac or its metabolites then cotreated for 12 h with drug plus 2 µM ?-lapachone the percentage cell survival results showed results that transfection with NQO1 siRNA caused a significant decrease in the cytotoxicity of combinations of ?-lapachone with sulindac (A) sulindac sulfone (B) or sulindac sulfide (C).

Discussion ?-lapachone Triggers Lung Cancer Cells to Undergo Apoptosis through an Increase in Intracellular Calcium Levels Increased JNK Activation Decreased Activation of PI3K ERK and AKT and a Decrease in the MMP Cell proliferation and cell death are under complex and precise control. Normally the proteins involved in cell proliferation survival or cell death are in a remarkable balance and unbalanced survival and apoptotic signals may lead to cell death. In most cells proliferation is mainly regulated through PI3K AKT and ERK 46 and cell death is regulated through another pathway involving JNK and p38 47 48 . JNK has recently been reported to be an important mediator in the ?-lapachone-induced cell death of breast and prostate cancer cells 45 49 . ?-lapachone also triggers cell death of many cancer cells by increasing calcium signaling 6 50 . Calcium the key messenger molecule in cells plays an important role in many signaling pathways and an imbalance in intracellular calcium levels causes abnormal cell function and leads to cell death. Treatment of cells with the intracellular calcium chelator BAPTA partially inhibited ?-lapachone-induced cell death showing that calcium was involved (). Activation of the cell death signal JNK (A) and inhibition of the cell survival signals p-PI3K p-AKT and p-ERK (A and B) were also observed in ?-lapachone-mediated lung cancer cell death showing that the MAP kinase signaling pathway is involved in the anticancer effect of ?-lapachone. Although ROS could have caused the cell death induced by ?-lapachone there was no change in intracellular H2O2 levels following ?-lapachone treatment (Figure S1D). However the MMP was dramatically decreased following ?-lapachone treatment (Figure S3C) suggesting that other ROS species might be involved in the ?-lapachone-induced cell death process. NQO1 is a Key Factor in the ?-lapachone-induced Lung Cancer Cell Death High NQO1 activity and expression are seen in many human tumors including carcinoma of the liver 51 52 colon 53 breast 52 54 brain 55 and lung 52 and NQO1 has been shown to be an important factor in ?-lapachone-induced cell death in many kinds of cancer cells 9 44 including breast cancer 2 glioma 56 and prostate cancer 44 . In this study we demonstrated that the cytotoxicity of ?-lapachone for three different lung cancer cell lines was positively correlated with their NQO1 expression and enzyme activity (). Inhibition of NQO1 activity using the NQO1 inhibitor dicoumarol (Figure S3) blocked the ?-lapachone-induced increase in intracellular calcium levels (Figure S3) increase in p-JNK levels (A) and decrease in p-ERK p-PI3K and p-AKT levels (A and B). These results indicated that the balance between survival and death signals in lung cancer cells was disrupted by the decrease in p-PI3K p-AKT and p-ERK levels and the increase in p-JNK levels caused by ?-lapachone treatment and that NQO1 expression and activity were involved in the activation of all these apoptotic signals. Anti-inflammatory Drugs Increase NQO1 Levels and Enzyme Activity in Lung Cancer Cells Many drugs or treatments such as cisplatin 5 heat shock 19 or radiation 57 can increase NQO1 expression or activity and facilitate the cytotoxicity of ?-lapachone for various cancer cells. However such drugs or treatments are usually harmful to normal cells as well as cancer cells so there is a need for drugs or treatments that can facilitate the anti-cancer effect of ?-lapachone while being less harmful for normal cells. Sulindac has been shown to be a potent chemo-protective agent against colorectal cancer in both human and animal models 25 while sulindac sulfide 18 and sulindac and its two metabolites 18 28 have been reported to upregulate the expression of carcinogen detoxification enzymes including NQO1. It is known that sulindac compounds inhibit the activity of COX-1 and COX-2 and thus block the biosynthesis of prostaglandins 58 - 60 . In in vivo studies sulindac has been shown to be reversibly reduced to sulindac sulfide which can be irreversibly oxidized to sulindac sulfone all three of which are anti-inflammatory. Since 1995 several clinical trials have established that sulindac is effective at reducing the number and size of polyps in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis a precursor to colorectal cancer (NCI-P97-0110 NCI-P00-0150 61 ).\nLabels: [Thyroid_Cancer, Colon_Cancer, Lung_Cancer]\nReply with one label only.", "assistant": "Lung_Cancer"}
{"system": "You are a medical text classifier. Choose exactly one label.", "user": "Text: in Japanese families 19 . A FTSJ2 locus in the genome gene amplification and mRNA over-expression were discovered in several non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissue samples 20 and FTSJ3 was revealed to function in pre-rRNA processing 21 22 . However little is known about these three homologs in mammals. Thus in this study we used E. coli RrmJ as a starting point to construct a phylogenetic tree containing several typological species and mammals which showed that FTSJ2 is an ortholog of RrmJ. Based on the highly conserved FTSJ2 protein sequences within mammals we established the basic characteristics of FTSJ2 and its gene expression during the heat shock response in different porcine tissues and human cancer cells. Because previous studies have shown the abnormal expression of FTSJ2 in NSCLC we further investigated the functions of FTSJ2 in cell invasion and migration using human lung adenocarcinoma and rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines. Materials and Methods Phylogenetic Analysis of the E. coli RrmJ Homologs The RrmJ domain of 39 protein sequences and the three out-group proteins fibrillarin (PDB code: 1FBN) 10 23 vaccinia VP39 (1AV6) 24 and catechol-O- methyltransferase (1VID) 25 which are structurally and functionally similar to E. coli RrmJ were used for the construction of a phylogenetic tree. The distance matrix was calculated using the JTT model. The minimum evolution (ME) method with 1000 bootstrap replicates was performed using the MEGA5 program (www.megasoftware.net ) 26 . The nodes of the tree with a bootstrapping support of 50 are shown. Database Search for RrmJ Homologs and the Multiple Sequence Alignment BLASTp was used to search the complete protein sequences in the non-redundant (nr) database at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) website. Fourteen proteins from humans Methanococcus jannaschii and three invertebrate species were obtained using E. coli RrmJ as a query and an E-value of 3e-08 was defined as the cut-off value. Twenty-two vertebrate proteins were found using human FTSJ1 FTSJ2 and FTSJ3 as the queries and a 50 amino acid identity was defined as the cut-off value in this search. The putative RrmJ domains of the 38 protein sequences were aligned with that of E. coli RrmJ using ClustalW and were slightly adjusted according to their predicted secondary structures which were calculated using the PORTER query (distill.ucd.ie porter ) 27 . The Animals and the Heat Stress Treatment Twelve three-month-old female Landrace Yorkshire crossbred (LYC) piglets were purchased from the Animal Industry Division of the Livestock Research Institute of the Council of Agriculture (COA) (Tainan Taiwan). The procedures used in this study were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the COA Livestock Research Institute (Approval No. 98021). The piglets (n? ?4) were raised at 25 C and 60 humidity in animal houses which were equipped for temperature and humidity control 28 29 . For the heat stress treatment the piglets that were raised at room temperature (25 C) were exposed to heat shock temperatures of 30 C or 35 C and maintained at 60 humidity for 1 week. The piglets were then sacrificed and tissue samples from 11 ans were isolated for total RNA extraction. Cell Culture The cancer cell lines of HepaG2 (ATCC No. HB-8065) TE671 (ATCC No. CCL-136) and A549 (ATCC No. CCL-185) were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas VA USA). The lung adenocarcinoma CL1 sublines CL1-0 and CL1-5 were kindly provided by Dr. Jeremy J.W. Chen National Chung Hsing University Taichung Taiwan 30 . All of the cell lines were grown in Dulbecco s Modified Eagle s Medium (DMEM; Invitrogen Corp. Grand Island NY USA) containing high glucose (4500 mg L) and supplemented with 10 fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37 C and 5 CO2. At 80 confluence the cells were subcultured at a ratio of 1?3 to 1?5 and the medium was changed every three days as described previously 31 32 . Heat Shock Treatment of the Cells In our heat shock response analysis the cancer cells that grew at 37 C and 5 CO2 were subjected to heat shock at 42 C or 45 C and 5 CO2 for 1 hour. After this heat shock treatment the cells were transferred to 37 C for 0 3 or 6 hours and then harvested for total RNA extraction. Cell Transfection via Electroporation The 6.74-kb pCMV-hFTSJ2-IRES2-DsRed plasmid was constructed by inserting the full-length human FTSJ2 (hFTSJ2) protein coding sequence into the EcoRI restriction site of the pIRES2-DsRed2 vector (Clontech Laboratories Inc. Mountain View CA USA). The TE671 and HepG2 cell lines were transfected with this plasmid via electroporation with a BTX ECM2001 system (BTX Holliston MA USA). Briefly 6 106 TE671 or 2 107 HepG2 cells were suspended in 400 µL of DMEM which contained 5 µg or 50 µg of plasmid DNA respectively and then the cells were subjected to electroporation at 200 V for 4 msec or 100 V for 30 msec respectively. After electroporation the cells were grown in a culture medium containing 400 µg mL of the antibiotic G418 for the selection of cells that were stably expressing hFTSJ2. Isolation of the Mitochondrial and Cytosolic Protein Fractions The mitochondrial and cytosolic proteins of the TE671 cell fractions were isolated using the reagent-based method of the Mitochondria Isolation Kit (Pierce Rockford IL USA) according to the manufacturer s instructions. Western Blot Analysis To analyze the expression of hFTSJ2 stable expression colonies of the TE671-hFTSJ2 and HepG2-hFTSJ2 cells were collected homogenized in 300 µL of RIPA buffer (5 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4 0.15 M NaCl 1 NP-40 0.25 sodium deoxycholate 5 mM EDTA pH 8.0 and 1 mM EGTA) held on ice for 30 min and then centrifuged at 14000 rpm for 30 min. The supernatants were collected as the total protein lysate. The supernatants (20 µg) were then separated by SDS-PAGE in a 12 acrylamide gel (acryl:bis of 30?0.8) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane 33 34 . The membrane was blocked with 5 BSA (filtered through a 0.22-µm membrane) and immunoblotted with anti-hFTSJ2 (1?1000) and anti-GAPDH (1?500) antibodies overnight at 4 C. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline containing Tween 20 (PBST) the membrane was incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 hour at 25 C and the protein bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Waltham MA USA) and an ImageQuant LAS 4000 mini system (GE Healthcare Biosciences Pittsburgh PA USA). For immunoblotting of the mitochondrial and cytosolic protein fractions 5 µg of protein from each fraction was separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-hFTSJ2 (1?1000) anti-VDAC (mitochondrial fraction control 1?1000) and or anti-MEK-1 (cytosolic fraction control 1?1000) antibodies. Immunofluorescence Microscopy The TE671-hFTSJ2 and HepG2-hFTSJ2 cells were grown to 80 confluence in 24-well dishes. Then the cells were fixed with 4 paraformaldehyde for 20 min and permeabilized with 0.1 0.3 Triton X-100 for 5 min followed by three washes with PBS. The cells were blocked with horse serum for 1 hour and incubated with an anti-hFTSJ2 antibody (1?1000) overnight at 4 C and then with the appropriate fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated antibody for 1 hour. The cells were counter-stained with MitoTracker Red CMXRos (Invitrogen Corp. Grand Island NY USA) to stain the mitochondria and DAPI to stain the nuclei and then mounted with glycerol. The cells were examined by laser scanning confocal fluorescence microscopy in which FITC was excited at 488 nm MitoTracker Red was excited at 580 nm and DAPI was excited at 358 nm. Real-time RT-PCR and Semi-quantitative RT-PCR The total RNA was isolated from the cell lines or the porcine tissues using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen Corp. Grand Island NY USA) according to the manufacturer s instructions. The total RNA was treated with DNase I\nLabels: [Thyroid_Cancer, Colon_Cancer, Lung_Cancer]\nReply with one label only.", "assistant": "Lung_Cancer"}

ATM rs189037 was a common polymorphism in the promoter of ATM gene. Studies have shown that this site possibly may regulate ATM protein activity due to regulation function of promoter as shown in most genes. And specific genotypes or haplotypes of ATM may play an important role in carcinogenesis through expression regulation or alternative splicing of the ATM gene 31 . We searched through NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) dbSNP database to get the allele frequency of this polymorphism. The data indicated that the frequency of wild-type allele G was 61.1 and the frequency of variant allele A was 38.9 in Chinese Han population (http: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov SNP snp_ref.cgi?rs rs189037). In this study our results was in accordance with the data from NCBI. In 2006 Kim et al. 25 evaluated the role of ATM rs189037 in lung cancer development In Korean population for the first time. No significant association was found between this polymorphism and lung cancer risk (P 0.05). They recruited 616 lung cancer patients in which 78.4 were male and 79.6 were cigarette smokers. As cigarette smoking might modulate the risk of lung cancer in turn it could be a confounder in the association between ATM rs189037 and lung cancer risk. Besides there was no gene-environment interactions be considered in their research. In 2010 Lo et al. 23 suggested that ATM rs189037 was associated with lung cancer risk among never smokers (AA vs GG: OR? ?1.61 95 CI 1.10 2.35) and this association might be modified by passive smoking. Although they have eliminated the cofounding effect of cigarette smoking by conducting their study in non-smokers the risk of lung cancer among different histological types still needed to be clarified. Recently Hsia et al. 24 put their attention on the association of ATM rs189037 with lung cancer susceptibility among ever smokers. No genotype frequency difference was found between lung cancer cases and controls among ever smokers (P 0.05). After summing up the omissions of their studies and combining with the current situation that Chinese non-smoking female lung adenocarcinoma incidence and fatality rate was increasingly rising up we performed this case-control study to elucidate the association between ATM rs189037 and lung adenocarcinoma risk. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study that has investigated whether ATM rs189037 was associated with lung adenocarcinoma risk in non-smoking Han-Chinese females. Our results have shown that individuals with exposure to cooking oil fume had a 1.63-fold increased risk of developing lung adenocarcinoma (P? ?0.011). Similar significant associations were observed in our previous studies of Chinese non-smoking females. Experimental studies have presented that fumes from cooking oils could be genotoxic because of the potential carcinogenic components such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and benzo a pyrene 78-diol 910-epoxide (BPDE) which involved in inducing DNA adducts and thus made a predisposition to lung adenocarcinoma 32 34 . Besides the method of cooking and throat or eyes irritation the interviewers also asked each woman the information on cooking oil fumes exposure such as the types of cooking oils she used the frequency she used stir frying or deep frying to prepare food ventilation conditions and the use of a fume extractor. Increasing epidemiological studies have reported cooking method and types of cooking oils on lung cancer susceptibility among Chinese females. Seow et al. 35 found that women who reported that they stir fried daily had a significantly increased risk of lung cancer (OR? ?2.0 95 CI 1.0 3.8) and risk was enhanced for those who stir fried meat daily (OR? ?2.7 95 CI 1.3 5.5). The elevated lung cancer risk might be attributed to heterocyclic amines generated during frying of meats. In addition the frequency of stir frying seemed to be related with lung cancer susceptibility. Gao et al. 36 investigated the association between the frequency of stir frying and lung cancer risk in Chinese females they observed that stir frying more than 30 dishes per week was associated with high risk of lung cancer (OR? ?2.6 95 CI 1.3 5.0). In a case-control study in northeast China Wu-Williams et al. 37 found that women who deep fried twice per month had a 2.1-fold increased risk of developing lung cancer than those who never used deep frying method. And there was a significant trend in risk with increasing number of meals cooked by deep frying. Also this kind of correlation was found in both non-smokers and lung adenocarcinoma population. For types of cooking oils Zhong et al. 38 reported that soybean oil was most commonly used in Shanghai and the use of rapeseed oil was associated with a higher risk of lung cancer (OR? ?1.84 95 CI 1.12 3.03). In this study we observed that ATM rs189037 AA genotype carriers were more susceptible to lung adenocarcinoma than GA or GG genotype carriers in a recessive model. This might not give direct support for AA genotype as a risk factor for lung adenocarcinoma. But the results reflected that G allele might be a protective factor for lung adenocarcinoma. So we compared AA genotype with GA genotype and our data showed that women who were AA genotype carriers had an elevated risk of lung adenocarcinoma (OR? ?1.74 95 CI 1.10 2.74 P? ?0.018). In other words GA genotype might be protective for developing lung adenocarcinoma. In the stratified analysis of cooking oil fumes exposure we also found that AA genotype carriers had a predisposition to lung adenocarcinoma in women who had no exposure of cooking oil fumes (OR? ?1.89 95 CI 1.03 3.49). Considering that G allele might be a protective factor for lung adenocarcinoma we then compared AA genotype with GA genotype to further validate our previous results. And it turned out that in the non-exposed group women who were AA genotype carriers had a higher risk of lung adenocarcinoma than those GA genotype carriers (OR? ?1.98 95 CI 1.15 3.40 P? ?0.014) which was in accordance with our previous data that G allele might be a protective factor for lung adenocarcinoma. But in the combined analysis of interaction of cooking oil fumes exposure and rs189037 polymorphism no significant association was found. We have described the distribution of any possible factors such as age passive smoking status fuel smoke exposure family history of cancer between cooking oil fumes exposed group and non-exposed group that might affect the association but none of these seemed to be different between exposed group and non-exposed group (). As tumor is a multifactorial disease we could infer that there might be other risk factors playing a role in the development of lung adenocarcinoma. We tended to believe that there might be other host genetic susceptibility or unknown risk factors caused the results. .0096911.t005 Comparisons of distribution of risk factors between cooking oil fumes exposed group and non-exposed group.

There are several limitations in the current study.

{"system": "You are a medical text classifier. Choose exactly one label.", "user": "Text: But PAX6 plays an oncogenic role in pancreatic cancer and retinoblastoma 4 22 .In pancreatic adenocarcinoma and pancreatic cancer cell lines down-regulation of PAX6 by specific siRNA leads to a decline in cell growth and cell apoptosis 12 . Methylation of PAX6-promoters is increased in early bladder cancer and methylated PAX6-promoters could be a represent biomarker for this disease 25 . And the suppression of PAX6 mRNA expression resulted in an inhibited growth and an increased apoptosis of cultured human retinoblastoma cells 26 . Our findings also reveal that PAX6 implicates an oncogenic function in lung cancer. In our results PAX6 mRNA was highly expressed in both lung cancer tissues and lung cancer cell lines. A549 and H1299 cell growth was inhibited by specific PAX6 shRNA. Suppression of PAX6 expression led to decreased cell growth and colony formation as well as anchorage-independent colony formation. But our findings indicate that cell apoptosis was not affected by the inhibition of PAX6 (data not shown). And cell migration was also not affected by the suppression of PAX6 mRNA (data not shown). PAX6 is cancer-dependent and has different signaling pathways in different tumors 13 20 24 26 . In HeLa cells PAX6 regulates cell-cycle progression by eliciting the expression of human RFPL1 (hRFPL1) which down-regulates cyclin B1 and Cdc2 expression and leads to the accumulation of cells in G2-M phase 27 . We also focused on the role of PAX6 in regulating cell cycle progression in lung cancer. In our cell cycle analysis cyclin D1 was suppressed in A549 PAX6 KD and H1299 PAX6 KD cells. It indicated that PAX6 expression promoted cell cycle progression by transitioning cells from G1 to S phase. Consistent with these findings cell cycle analysis showed a significant reduction of G0 G1 arrest and a significant induction of G2 M arrest in PAX6 overexpression human retinoblastoma cells 28 . Cyclin D1-CDK4 and cyclin D1-CDK6 complexes in the early to mid-G1 phase phosphorylate and inactivate pRB 29 30 . Our findings in this study implicate that the pRB S780 phosphorylation level was weakened when PAX6 expression was inhibited. Thus we demonstrated that PAX6 increased the expression of cyclin D1 and enhanced cell growth by promoting the G1-S transition. Mitogen-induced Ras signaling promotes transcription of the cyclin D1 gene and it depends on the MAPK signal pathway 31 . Our findings indicate that inhibition of PAX6 decreases the phosphorylation level of ERK1 2 and p38. These studies suggest that PAX6 regulates cell G1 S progression via MAPK signal pathway in lung cancer cells. However the regulatory mechanism of PAX6 in lung cancer is still unclear. A recent study showed that PAX6 promotes cell growth by activating the MET tyrosine kinase receptor gene in pancreatic carcinoma 13 . In lung cancer cells ERK1 2 signal pathway is involved in the MET pathway 32 . Our finding indicated that ERK1 2 was activated by PAX6 expression. So that we suppose that PAX6 activates MAPK signaling and promotes cell cycle progression via MET gene transcription in lung cancer. PAX6 is primarily expressed during embryogenesis; little or no PAX6 protein is detected in adult tissues 3 . As PAX6 is frequently expressed in tumors 9 we determined the PAX6 level in primary lung cancer tissues. The PAX6 expression level in matched adjacent tissues was measured as a control. Similar to pancreatic tumors PAX6 expression was stronger in lung cancer tissues than in adjacent tissues. The cancer-to-adjacent nontumorous tissue ratio of PAX6 mRNA expression for each individual was calculated. Only 3 ratios were less than 1 and most of the ratios were much more than 100. All these findings demonstrated that PAX6 functioned as an oncogenic factor in lung cancer. Conclusions In this study we report that increased expression of PAX6 was noted in primary lung cancer tissues. PAX6 promoted cell growth by activating MAPK signalling and accelerating cell cycle progression. Moreover PAX6 regulated G1-S progression by inducing cyclin D1 expression and pRB phosphorylation. Our data suggests that PAX6 is a new potential target in lung cancer. The authors would like to thank Meng Gu for assistance with samples collection.

This study is to investigate whether inhibitors of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) which increase intracellular cGMP levels modulate the cytotoxicity and uptake of anti-cancer drugs in cancer cells. Methods The experiments were conducted with and without PDE5 inhibitors: dipyridamole vardenafil and or sildenafil. The cytotoxicity of doxorubicin cisplatin and oxaliplatin was determined in multiple cancer cell lines derived from different tissues. The cellular uptake of structurally diverse compounds was further examined in lung cancer cells with and without various endocytotic inhibitors. The tumor accumulation and the anti-tumor effect of trastuzumab were examined in a lung cancer xenograft mouse model. Results Dipyridamole could modulate the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin cisplatin and oxaliplatin in cancer cells. Particularly PDE5 inhibitors increased cellular uptake of structurally diverse compounds into lung cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. The effect of vardenafil on drug uptake could be blocked by endocytotic inhibitors. The growth of lung cancer xenograft in nude mice was significantly suppressed by addition of vardenafil to trastuzumab treatment. Conclusion PDE5 inhibitors may increase the efficacy of anti-cancer drugs by increasing endocytosis-mediated cellular drug uptake and thus serve as adjuvant therapy for certain cancers such as lung cancer. phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor doxorubicin trastuzumab endocytosis lung cancer National Institute of General Medical Sciences : NIGMS R01 GM099742 GM BMC Pulm Med BMC Pulm Med BMC Pulmonary Medicine 1471-2466 BioMed Central 24885608 4027997 1471-2466-14-83 10.1186 1471-2466-14-83 Case Report Extraordinary response to crizotinib in a woman with squamous cell lung cancer after two courses of failed chemotherapy Wang Qiushi 1 wqsdpbl 163.com He Yong 2 heyong8998 126.com Yang Xin 1 32317432 qq.com Wang Yubo 2 wangyubo_110 163.com Xiao Hualiang 1 dpbl_xhl 126.com 1Department of Pathology Daping Hospital and Research Institute of Surgery Third Military Medical University Chongqing 400042 China 2Department of Respiration Daping Hospital and Research Institute of Surgery Third Military Medical University Chongqing 400042 China 2014 15 5 2014 14 83 83 20 3 2014 8 5 2014 Copyright 2014 Wang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. 2014 Wang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Background The discovery of the fusion gene echinodermmicro tubule associated proteinlike 4-anaplastic lymphoma kinase EML4-ALK in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer has led to the remarkable development of anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibitors such as crizotinib. Consequently the clinical outcomes of these patients have improved dramatically. Herein we report the case of a woman with ALK gene translocation-squamous cell lung cancer who experienced a remarkable tumor response to crizotinib after two courses of failed chemotherapy. Case presentation A 55-year-old Chinese woman was diagnosed with cervical lymph node metastatic squamous carcinoma. Chest computed tomography scan showed the primary tumor in the lower lobe of the right lung. The patient had received two successive courses of first-line chemotherapy without tumor response. Tumor cells were negative for wild-type of epidermal growth factor receptor K-RAS variants; thus she was not eligible for tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. Unfortunately increased levels of interleukin-6 and carcinoembryonic antigen and computed tomography scan results indicated cancer progression. Once crizotinib was approved by the China Food and Drug Administration and the ALK gene translocation was identified in tumor cells by fluorescent in situ hybridization the patient commenced treatment with crizotinib. Remarkably the tumor response to crizotinib was classified as partial response after only 26 days of treatment commencement. The partial response status has been maintained to date (23 weeks). Conclusion Considering this remarkable response to crizotinib we can safely conclude that patients with squamous cell lung cancer should have the option of undergoing ALK testing to determine if there is indication for crizotinib treatment even after they have failed chemotherapy. ALK Crizotinib Squamous cell lung cancer Chemotherapy Background Treatment of EML4-ALK fusion-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-targeted agent crizotinib offers significant improvement of clinical outcomes 1 . Herein we report the successful case of a patient with squamous cell lung cancer and ALK gene translocation that experienced a remarkable response to crizotinib treatment after two courses of failed chemotherapy. Case presentation A 55-year-old woman presented in May 2013 with cough sputum and annihilation after activities of daily living for more than 20 days. She had no history of smoking or alcoholism but had undergone total hysterectomy because of hysteromyoma in 2010. She was diagnosed with hypertension three years earlier. On physical examination an enlarged right cervical lymph node was palpated. Chest computed tomography (CT) scan (Figure 1A) indicated the presence of a mass in the lower lobe of the right lung and mediastinal lymph node enlargement. The patient was then accepted and treated by the Department of Respiration for lung cancer stage IV with cervical lymph node metastasis (T4N3M1). Figure 1 Chest computed tomography (CT) scans. Before the first chemotherapy treatment (May 2013) (A). After the second course of chemotherapy (B). After 26 days (C) and 11 weeks (D) of crizotinib treatment. The whole enlarged right cervical lymph node was resected and followed by biopsy and histologic examination. Hematoxylin and eosin (H E) staining showed the typical morphology of squamous cell carcinoma cells (Figure 2A and B). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis demonstrated that tumor cells were positive for cytokeratin (CK) 5 6 (Figure 2C) and P63 (Figure 2D) and negative for CK7 CK20 TTF-1 and Napsin A. The positive rate of Ki-67 was 30 . Altogether these results confirmed the diagnosis of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma. The patient requested treatment with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) because dozens of patients with squamous cell carcinoma and EGFR mutations responded well to TKIs at our institute. Amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) was used to assess EGFR and K-RAS gene profiles to determine the presence of mutated variants. However evidence of a normal genotype excluded the patient from receiving EGFR-TKI treatment. Figure 2 Right cervical lymph node analysis. H E staining (A and B). IHC staining of CK5 6 (C) P63 (D) and ALK (1A4) (E). ALK gene translocation (FISH arrows: split-apart signals for ALK gene translocation) (F). As first-line chemotherapy the patient was initially administered 135 mg m2 (210 mg) of paclitaxel and 80 mg m2 (120 mg) of nedaplatin. During treatment the patient s condition did not seem to improve; thus after a 20-day treatment a second round of chemotherapy was administered with 75 mg m2 (120 mg) of docetaxel and 80 mg m2 (120 mg) of nedaplatin. Unfortunately increasing levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) (25.41 vs 16.03 pg mL) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (23.43 vs 7.13 ng mL) indicated cancer progression which was confirmed by the presence of multiple metastases in both lungs on CT scan images (Figure 1B). Although not initially indicated the patient was then administered oral treatment with the EGFR-TKI erlotinib (1-month trial). However this treatment showed no efficacy. After the use of crizotinib was approved by the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) in July 2013 the patient underwent ALK testing. IHC staining (Clone 1A4 Origene 1:200) showed tumor cell positivity for ALK protein (Figure 2E). Then ALK break-apart fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed on 4-?m formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections. Slides were hybridized with the LSI ALK Break Apart Rearrangement Probe (Vysis Abbott Molecular Des Plaines IL USA) and read on an epifluorescence microscope (BX41 Olympus Tokyo Japan). The lung cancer cell line NCI-H2228 (American Type Culture Collection-ATCC) was used as positive control. At least 50 tumor cell nuclei were analyzed and at least 15 of interpretable tumor cells harboring break-apart signals were used as the cutoff value 2 .\nLabels: [Thyroid_Cancer, Colon_Cancer, Lung_Cancer]\nReply with one label only.", "assistant": "Lung_Cancer"}

Association of BANCR expression with patients survival Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was conducted to investigate the correlation between BANCR expression and NSCLC patient prognosis. According to relative BANCR expression in tumor tissues the 113 NSCLC patients were classified into two groups: the high BANCR group (n? ?53 fold-change???4); and the low BANCR group (n? ?60 fold-change ?4) (B). With respect to progression-free survival (PFS) this was 35.3 for the high BANCR group and 17.2 for the low BANCR group. Median survival time for the high BANCR group was 31 months and 16 months for the low BANCR group (C). The overall survival rate over 3 years for the high BANCR group was 46 and 27.5 for the low BANCR group. Median survival time for the high BANCR group was 32 months and 18 months for the low BANCR group (D). Univariate analysis identified three prognostic factors: lymph node metastasis; TNM stage; and BANCR expression level. Other clinicopathological features such as gender and age were not statistically significant prognosis factors (). Multivariate analysis of the three prognosis factors confirmed that a low BANCR expression level was an independent predictor of poor survival for NSCLC (p? ?0.031) in addition to TNM stage (p? ?0.038) ().

Histone deacetylation is involved in the downregulation of BANCR Expression levels of BANCR in NSCLC cell lines were determined by qPCR. Compared with that in 16HBE cells relative expression levels of BANCR were reduced in NSCLC cells (A). Because of the different expression patterns for BANCR in NSCLC and melanomas we investigated the mechanisms controlling tissue-specific expression of BANCR. We analyzed the promoter region of BANCR and found there were no CpG islands (data not shown). Histone protein modification was thought to play an important role in the transcription of lncRNAs; however knockdown of two core subunits of polycomb repressive complex 2 (SUZ12 and EZH2) had no influence on BANCR expression (Additional file 2: Figure S1A). Histone deacetylation is involved in BANCR downregulation. (A) BANCR expression levels of NSCLC cell lines (A549 SPC-A1 H1299 H1650 H1975 and SK-MES-1) compared with that in normal human bronchial epithelial cells (16HBE). (B) qPCR analysis of BANCR expression levels following the treatment of SPC-A1 and A549 cells with TSA. (C) qPCR analysis of HDAC2 and HDAC3 expression levels following the treatment of SPC-A1 and A549 cells with si-HDAC2 or si-HDAC3.(D E) qPCR analysis of BANCR expression levels following the treatment of SPC-A1 and A549 cells with si-HDAC1 and si-HDAC3. We observed that BANCR expression was upregulated in SPC-A1 and A549 cells following treatment with the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) (B). We sought to determine whether repression of BANCR was mediated by HDACs. Specific anti-HDAC1 and HDAC3 siRNAs were transfected into NSCLC cells and HDAC1 and HDAC3 expression was significantly decreased (C). Expression levels of BANCR were significantly upregulated in cells transfected with si-HDAC3. Transfection with the scrambled siRNA or si-HDAC1 did not induce BANCR expression (D and E). Moreover the HDAC3 expression was upregulated in NSCLC cells and negatively correlated with BANCR expression (Additional file 2: Figure S1B). Furthermore NSCLC cells were treated with RGFP966 which is an seletive inhibitor for HDAC3 with an IC50 of 0.08?M and no effective inhibition of other HDACs at concentrations up to 15?M. The results of qPCR showed that the expression of BANCR was upregulated in NSCLC cells after treated with RGFP966 when compared with control cells (Additional file 2: Figure S1C). These data indicate that HDAC3 knockdown induced BANCR increase may be due to the inhibition of HDAC3 enzymatic activity. BANCR inhibits NSCLC cell viability and induces apoptosis To assess the biological role of BANCR in NSCLC we investigated the effects of BANCR over-expression on the viability and apoptosis of SPCA1 or A549 cells. Our qPCR results revealed that BANCR expression was significantly upregulated compared with that in control cells (A). MTT assay results showed that the growth of SPC-A1 and A549 cells transfected with pCDNA-BANCR was impaired compared with that for control cells (B and C). Colony formation assay results revealed that clonogenic survival was inhibited following overexpression of BANCR in SPC-A1 and A549 cells (D). Flow cytometry analysis of SPC-A1 and A549 cells showed that upregulation of BANCR expression promoted apoptosis in comparison with that in control cells (E).

BANCR inhibits migration and invasion of NSCLC cells The wound healing assay results showed that cells transfected with pCDNA-BANCR resulted in a slower closing of scratch wounds compared with that for control cells (A and B). We evaluated cancer cell invasion through matrigel and migration through transwells. Increased BANCR expression levels impeded the migration of SPC-A1 and A549 cells by approximately 64 compared with controls (C and D). Similarly invasion of SPC-A1 and A549 cells was also reduced by 59 following upregulation of BANCR expression. Effects of BANCR on NSCLC migration and invasion in vitro. SPC-A1 and A549 cells were transfected with pCDNA-BANCR. (A B) Wound-healing assays were used to investigate the migratory ability of NSCLC cells.

Knockdown of BANCR expression promotes NSCLC cells invasion To determine whether inhibition of BANCR expression could promote NSCLC cells viability and invasion we performed targeted knockdown of BANCR expression using RNA interference (RNAi) in A549 cells (A). MTT assays revealed that downregulation of BANCR expression did not affect cell viability (data not shown). However decreased BANCR expression levels promoted A549 cell migration and invasion in vitro (B). Effects of BANCR overexpression on tumor metastasis in vivo. (A) BANCR expression levels were determined by qPCR following the treatment of A549 cells with si-BANCR. (B) Transwell assays were conducted to determine the migratory and invasive abilities of si-BANCR-transfected A549 cells. Analysis of an experimental metastasis animal model was performed by injecting BANCR-overexpressing SPC-A1 cells into nude mice.

BANCR suppresses NSCLC cell metastasis in vivo To validate the effects of BANCR on the metastasis of NSCLC cells in vivo SPCA1 cells stably transfected with pCDNA-BANCR were injected into nude mice. Metastatic nodules on the surface of lungs were counted after 7 weeks. Ectopic overexpression of BANCR resulted in a reduction of the number of metastatic nodules compared with those in the control group (C). This difference was further confirmed following examination of the entire lungs and through hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining of lung sections (D). Our in vivo data complemented the results of functional in vitro studies involving BANCR. BANCR influences NSCLC cell EMT We conducted qPCR and western blotting assays to detect the expression of EMT-induced markers (E-cadherin N-cadherin and Vimentin) in cells over-expressing BANCR. Our findings showed that increased BANCR expression levels induced E-cadherin expression while decreased N-cadherin Vimentin and MMP-2 expression (Figure 6A). Simultaneously upregulation of BANCR expression led to decreased SNAIL1 SNAIL2 and SIP1 expression (Figure 6B). Western blotting and immunofluorescence analysis also revealed that enhanced BANCR expression stimulated E-cadherin expression and reduced Vimentin expression in NSCLC cells (Figure 6B and C).

Discussion Recent evidence has shown that ncRNAs play an important role in cancer pathogenesis and could provide new insights into the biology of this disease 2122 . Over the past decade microRNAs (miRNAs) have moved to the forefront of ncRNA research in NSCLC. However lncRNAs in NSCLC are still an emerging field with only a handful of lncRNAs involved in NSCLC tumorigenesis. One of these lncRNAs is metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1). MALAT1 also known as NEAT2 (nuclear-enriched abundant transcript 2) is a highly conserved nuclear lncRNA and a predictive marker for metastasis development in lung cancer 23 . In this study we found that the expression of another lncRNA BANCR was significantly downregulated in NSCLC tissues. Specifically BANCR expression was significantly lower at the later stages of tumor development and in tumors that had undergone extensive metastasis. Moreover the overall survival time of patients with lower BANCR expression levels was significantly shorter than that for patients with higher BANCR expression levels. Our results indicate that BANCR expression provided a significant independent predictive value for TNM stage (P? ?0.038). We demonstrated that upregulation of BANCR expression led to the significant inhibition of cell viability migration invasion and promotion of apoptosis. Knockdown of BANCR expression promoted cell migration and invasion. BANCR induced cell apoptosis may be partly via P53 which could contribute to the less cells in migration and invasion; however the impaired migration and invasion ability is the main reason which could be supported by wound-healing assay. Moreover increased BANCR expression levels resulted in a significant reduction in the number of metastatic nodules on the lungs in vivo. These findings suggest that BANCR plays a direct role in the modulation of cell metastasis and NSCLC progression and may be useful as a novel prognostic or progression marker for NSCLC. Tumor development and progression is precisely regulated by several subsets of genes that act by either silencing tumor suppressor genes or activating oncogenes 24 . Tumor suppressor genes can negatively regulate cell proliferation by inducing growth arrest and inhibiting cell invasion. In cancer cells tumor suppressor genes are usually silenced by genetic or epigenetic alterations 25 . Whether epigenetic regulatory factors such as histone acetylation or DNA methylation manipulate the expression of lncRNAs remains unclear. Hypermethylation of the promoter or the intergenic differentially methylated region has been found to contribute to reduced lncRNA MEG3 expression in tumors indicating that epigenetic regulation is also involved in the expression of these genes 2627 . Our findings highlight that histone acetylation is a key factor in controlling lncRNA BANCR expression. These results along with those from a recent study 28 highlight the role of epigenetics in regulating lncRNA transcription. To explore the molecular mechanism through which BANCR contributes to the invasion and metastasis of NSCLC we investigated potential target proteins involved in cell motility and matrix invasion. Hallmarks of EMT are the loss of E-cadherin expression and aberrant expression of N-cadherin and Vimentin 29-32 . Therefore we determined the protein levels of these EMT-induced markers following BANCR overexpression. Our results indicated that inhibitory effects on cell migration and invasion were associated with EMT. Matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) are also important to many aspects of biology ranging from cell proliferation differentiation and remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) to vascularization and cell migration. Upregulation of BANCR expression in NSCLC cells led to a significant decrease in MMP2 protein levels. Our findings demonstrated that BANCR mediated NSCLC cell migration invasion and metastasis suppression which possibly also affected EMT. As a central differentiation process EMT allows for remodeling of tissues during the early stages of embryogenesis and is implicated in the promotion of tumor cell invasion and metastasis 733 . It has been proposed and supported by many studies that EMT could be a potent mechanism for promoting the detachment of cancer cells from primary tumors. A characteristic of cells that undergo EMT is increased expression levels of N-cadherin and Vimentin and a loss of E-cadherin expression. Importantly EMT has been reported to be associated with poor clinical outcome in NSCLC 3435 . Therefore lncRNAs as regulators of EMT might be suitable candidates for intervention in the treatment of cancer. Although only a small number of functional lncRNAs have been well characterized to date they have been shown to regulate gene expression at various levels including chromatin modification transcription and post-transcriptional processing. Hox transcript antisense intergenic RNA (HOTAIR) is one of the most studied lncRNAs involved in chromatin modification which can target PRC2 genome-wide to alter H3K27 methylation and gene expression patterns 22 . A muscle-specific lncRNA linc-MD1 may function as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) to sponge miRNAs thereby modulating the derepression of miRNA targets and impose an additional level of post-transcriptional regulation 36 . Here although we observed BANCR overexpression induced NSCLC cells apoptosis and regulate EMT phenotype the possible mechanisms that underlie such regulatory behaviors still remain to be fully understood. Further investigation of BANCR molecular and biological functions in controlling EMT will undoubtedly be important in understanding the molecular biology of NSCLC metastasis and progression. Conclusions The expression of BANCR was significantly decreased in NSCLC tissues suggesting that its downregulation may be a negative prognostic factor for NSCLC patients and indicative of poor survival rates and a higher risk for cancer metastasis. We showed that BANCR possibly regulates the invasive and metastatic ability of NSCLC cells partially through regulation of EMT. Our findings further the understanding of NSCLC pathogenesis and development and facilitate the development of lncRNA-directed diagnostics and therapeutics against cancers. However the molecular mechanisms through which BACNR regulates EMT requires further investigation. Methods Tissue collection We obtained 113 paired NSCLC and adjacent non-tumor lung tissues from patients who underwent surgery at Jiangsu Province Hospital between 2008 and 2010 and were diagnosed with NSCLC (stages I II and III) based on histopathological evaluation. Clinicopathological characteristics including tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging were recorded. No local or systemic treatment was conducted in these patients before surgery. All collected tissue samples were immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 C until required. Our study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Nanjing Medical University China. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. Cell lines Five NSCLC adenocarcinoma cell lines (A549 SPC-A1 NCI-H1975 NCI-H1299 and NCI-H1650) a NSCLC squamous carcinomas cell line (SK-MES-1) and a normal human bronchial epithelial cell line (16HBE) were purchased from the Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai China). A549 SK-MES-1 NCI-H1975 NCI-H1299 NCI-H1650 and 16HBE cells were cultured in RPMI 1640; SPC-A1 cells were cultured in DMEM (GIBCO-BRL) medium supplemented with 10 fetal bovine serum (FBS) 100 U ml penicillin and 100 mg ml streptomycin (Invitrogen Carlsbad CA USA) at 37ºC 5 CO2. RNA extraction and qPCR assays Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer s instructions. Total RNA (500 ng) was reverse transcribed in a final volume of 10 ?l using random primers under standard conditions for the PrimeScript RT reagent Kit (TaKaRa Dalian China). We used the SYBR Premix Ex Taq (TaKaRa Dalian China) to determine BANCR expression levels following the manufacturer s instructions. Results were normalized to the expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). The specific primers used are presented in Additional file 3: Table S2. The qPCR assays were conducted on an ABI 7500 and data collected with this instrument. Our qPCR results were analyzed and expressed relative to threshold cycle (CT) values and then converted to fold changes. Plasmid generation The BANCR sequence was synthesized and subcloned into the pCDNA3.1 (Invitrogen Shanghai China) vector.\nLabels: [Thyroid_Cancer, Colon_Cancer, Lung_Cancer]\nReply with one label only.", "assistant": "Lung_Cancer"}
{"system": "You are a medical text classifier. Choose exactly one label.", "user": "Text: Validation of samples The primary aim of this scheme was to develop a flexible scalable EQA scheme designed to assess issues related to techniques and minimum detection limits used in standard laboratory practice focusing exclusively on the analytical (that is sample processing genotyping) and reporting phases (interpretation of the results in relation to the clinical context). To enable this and to avoid the significant challenges of sample heterogeneity in real tissue samples 20 artificial materials were used composed of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) cell line samples. These EQA materials were designed to mimic real tissue samples as closely as possible and contained homogenous mixtures of mutant vs wild-type cell lines at a range of different allelic ratios. The paraffin blocks were cut and 10??m sections placed in eppendorf tube at the Pathology department of the VU University Medical Centre in Amsterdam The Netherlands by Dr Erik Thunnissen. H E (4??m) sections were used to estimate the number of tumour cells. In each EQA sample section at least 200 nuclei were present (usually 300) roughly mimicking the amount of cells from a small NSCLC biopsy. For each EQA sample one 10-?m-thick section was sent by EMQN to each of the three validating laboratories for mutational analysis in a blinded fashion. Different sections from the block were analysed for EGFR mutation status to ensure that the mutation was homogeneously represented within each block. The validating laboratories independently analysed the samples by using three different approaches: direct sequencing of the PCR product for exons 18 21 mutations; fragment analysis for exon 19 deletions and an allelic discrimination-based real-time PCR assay for the L858R mutation in exon 21; and the Therascreen EGFR RGQ kit (Qiagen Hilden Germany) reporting the results directly to the EMQN. The allelic ratios of mutations in each sample used in rounds 2 and 3 were accurately quantified by a commercial sponsor (Horizon Diagnostics Cambridge UK) using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) on a BioRad QX100 (Hercules CA USA) platform. Genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted from FFPE sections on the Promega (Madison WI USA) Maxwell System using the Maxwell 16 FFPE Plus LEV DNA purification kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. Quantification was performed using a Promega QuantiFluor dsDNA assay kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. ddPCR was performed using Taqman custom SNP 40 primer probe assays (Life Technologies Carlsbad CA USA) to assess the frequency of each mutation with the exception of the p.(E746_A750) assay which was designed in-house. DNA (40?ng) was added to each ddPCR reaction. Reactions were performed in quadruplicate and droplets were generated using a Droplet Generator according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR was performed on a standard thermocycler using previously optimised assay-specific cycling conditions. Droplets were analysed using a QX100 Droplet Reader as described in the manufacturer's instructions. Data from at least 45?000 useable droplets were collected for each sample. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded reference standards (Horizon Diagnostics) were included as assay controls. Registration of participant laboratories and shipment of samples Laboratories that performed EGFR mutational analysis were invited to participate in the EQA via an open call from the EMQN in conjunction with the ESP ETOP and ESMO. Participating laboratories registered via the EMQN website (European Molecular Genetics Quality Network (EMQN) 2014) and were requested to perform DNA extraction and analysis using their routine method. In each round 10 samples (one 10-?m-thick section for each) with accompanying mock clinical referral information were sent to participating laboratory. Each laboratory was identified only by a unique EMQN ID code to avoid exchange of information between participants and minimise bias in the results' interpretation process. The laboratories were given 8 weeks to complete their analyses and to submit the results of genotyping to the EMQN website. The centres were requested to provide information on the technique used for mutational analysis and metrics relating to their experience of performing EGFR mutational analyses. Evaluation of results The scheme included three rounds: the first was restricted to a maximum of 30 labs to establish proof of principle and validate the materials. A subsequent second round of the scheme was anised with no restriction on participation. Laboratories that failed the second round were provided with another set of samples in a restricted third round. The steering group evaluated the results according to a pre-defined scoring system. The scoring system assigned two points to correct genotype and zero points to false-positive or -negative results (). Errors in mutation nomenclature that might lead to misinterpretation of the results (for example stating deletion' without specifying the exon in which the deletion occurs) were assigned 1.50 points. This deduction was applied only once for each center generally to the first sample for which the error was found. One point was awarded for cases in which the genotype was mispositioned or miscalled: this error sometimes occurs with exon 19 deletions for which it might be difficult to define the precise base or amino acid in which the deletion starts or ends. If a test failed giving no result on the sample (analytical failure) then the lab received 1.00 point for that sample. The threshold to pass the EQA was set at a total score for the 10 samples of ?18 out of 20 (Thunnissen et al 2011) laboratories with a genotyping score 18 were classified as poor performers (applied to rounds 2 and 3 only). Performance in the assessment of clinical interpretation and reporting did not contribute to poor performance. Results Selection of the samples for the EQA The first step of the EQA scheme was the selection and the validation of the samples. Twenty materials were manufactured by Dr Thunnissen by mixing four lung cancer cell lines (A549 EGFR wild type) H1650 (EGFR p.(E746_A750del) H1975 (EGFR p.(T790M) p.(L858R)) and SW48 (p.G719S). Cell lines with mutations were serially diluted into A549 or SIHA cells at different ratios relevant to establishing the analytical sensitivity of the tests used by labs. Each material was validated in three different reference laboratories using different techniques to confirm the genotype and the results showed that the mutations were detectable at all the designated ratios dependent on the technology used (). A good yield of gDNA was obtained from all the samples. In addition there was complete concordance on the EGFR mutational status of the selected specimens and therefore all were selected for use in the quality assessment scheme with samples A1 A10 used for the pilot and B1 10 and C1 C10 in subsequent rounds 2 and 3. To accurately establish quantitative measurements of the allelic frequencies of the EGFR mutations all 10 EQA samples (; samples B C1 B C10) used in rounds 2 and 3 were analysed on a ddPCR platform (BioRad QX100). Three of the samples had allelic frequencies higher than expected (C3 C8 and C9) two were lower (C2 and C10) and in one (C5) it was not possible to establish the true value due to insufficient availability of sample material (). First round proof of principle pilot scheme Twenty-nine laboratories registered from 13 countries and 25 participated in the pilot EQA scheme (4 labs withdrew due to customs sample importation problems) which was run in fourth quarter of 2011. A set of 10 samples were sent to the laboratories (; samples A1 A10). All the participating laboratories submitted results within the 8-week time frame. The main methodology used by the participants was PCR sequencing (n 10 laboratories; 34 ) and real-time PCR (n 10; 34 ) (). Two analytical errors (false-negative results) were observed. A further five laboratories made process errors (sample swaps) that resulted in an additional 24 genotype errors. In all cases the genotypes were correct but reported for the wrong sample. Therefore 92 of the false-negative results were concentrated in five laboratories. No false-positive results were reported. The materials performed well and there were no analytical test failures.\nLabels: [Thyroid_Cancer, Colon_Cancer, Lung_Cancer]\nReply with one label only.", "assistant": "Lung_Cancer"}

DDM is based on interpolation of the dose values from one dose grid to another and thus lacks rigor in defining the dose when there are multiple dose values mapped to one dose voxel in the reference phase due to tissue tumor deformation. On the other hand EMT counts the total energy and mass transferred to each voxel in the reference phase and calculates the dose by dividing the energy by mass. Therefore it is based on fundamentally sound physics principles. In this study we implemented the two algorithms and integrated them within the Eclipse TPS. We then compared the clinical dosimetric difference between the two algorithms for 10 lung cancer patients receiving stereotactic radiosurgery treatment by accumulating the delivered dose to the end-of-exhale (EE) phase. Specifically the respiratory period was divided into 10 phases and the dose to each phase was calculated and mapped to the EE phase and then accumulated. The displacement vector field (DVF) generated by Demons-based registration of the source and reference images was used to transfer the dose and energy. The DDM and EMT algorithms produced noticeably different cumulative dose in the regions with sharp mass density variations and or high dose gradients. For the PTV and ITV minimum dose the difference was up to 11 and 4 respectively. This suggests that DDM might not be adequate for obtaining an accurate dose distribution of the cumulative plan instead EMT should be considered.

Background Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) is an important approach to the analysis of coordinate expression changes at a pathway level. Although many statistical and computational methods have been proposed for GSEA the issue of a concordant integrative GSEA of multiple expression data sets has not been well addressed. Among different related data sets collected for the same or similar study purposes it is important to identify pathways or gene sets with concordant enrichment. Methods We categorize the underlying true states of differential expression into three representative categories: no change positive change and negative change. Due to data noise what we observe from experiments may not indicate the underlying truth. Although these categories are not observed in practice they can be considered in a mixture model framework. Then we define the mathematical concept of concordant gene set enrichment and calculate its related probability based on a three-component multivariate normal mixture model. The related false discovery rate can be calculated and used to rank different gene sets. Results We used three published lung cancer microarray gene expression data sets to illustrate our proposed method. One analysis based on the first two data sets was conducted to compare our result with a previous published result based on a GSEA conducted separately for each individual data set. This comparison illustrates the advantage of our proposed concordant integrative gene set enrichment analysis. Then with a relatively new and larger pathway collection we used our method to conduct an integrative analysis of the first two data sets and also all three data sets. Both results showed that many gene sets could be identified with low false discovery rates. A consistency between both results was also observed. A further exploration based on the KEGG cancer pathway collection showed that a majority of these pathways could be identified by our proposed method. Conclusions This study illustrates that we can improve detection power and discovery consistency through a concordant integrative analysis of multiple large-scale two-sample gene expression data sets. issue-copyright-statement BioMed Central Ltd 2014 Background The recent large-scale technologies like microarrays 1 3 and RNA-seq 4 5 allow us to collect genome-wide expression profiles for biomedical studies. Genes showing significant differential expression are potentially important biomarkers 6 . Furthermore a gene set enrichment analysis enables us to identify groups of genes (e.g. pathways) showing coordinate differential expression 7 8 . For some disease studies multiple gene expression data sets have been collected and the related integrative analysis of multiple data sets has been investigated 9 . Since microarray and sequencing based genome-wide expression data sets have been increasingly collected it is necessary to further develop the computational and statistical methods for integrative data analysis studies. Genes and gene sets showing consistent behavior among multiple related studies can be of great biological interest. However since the sample sizes are usually small but the numbers of genes are large it is difficult to identify truly differentially expressed genes and determine whether a gene or a gene set behaves concordantly among different related studies. Although the integrative analysis of multiple gene expression data sets has been well studied in recent years 10 11 the genome-wide concordance has not been well considered. Misleading results may be generated if the concordance among different data sets is not considered in an integrative analysis. Our purpose is to identify pathways or gene sets with concordant enrichment. Recently there are several methods published for meta gene set enrichment analysis of expression data 12 13 . However these methods have not been specifically developed for our study purpose. Statistically we need analysis methods that are consistent with the study purpose. There is still a lack of methods and software for the concordant integrative gene set enrichment analysis. For a gene set enrichment analysis an enriched gene set in one data set may also be enriched in another data set. However this gene set is not necessarily concordantly enriched in both data sets. For an illustration let us consider a simple artificial example: gene set S contains five genes with the first three genes strongly up-regulated in the first data set (the last two genes non-differentially expressed) and the last three genes strongly up-regulated in the second data set (the first two genes non-differentially expressed). Then in general gene set S is enriched in up-regulated differential expression in both data sets. However there is only one gene up-regulated in both data sets; the remaining genes are showing inconsistent behavior. Therefore unless the proportions of differentially expressed genes are small there is a lack of evidence to conclude that gene set S is concordantly enriched in both data sets. Since a gene set concordantly enriched in several similar studies may be of great importance it is necessary to develop statistical methods for detecting these gene sets. It has been shown that a mixture model based approach can be an efficient approach to the differential expression analysis 14 . Furthermore Lung_Cancer we have also demonstrated the usefulness of mixture models in concordant analysis of differential expression among large-scale expression data sets 15 16 . The advantage of the mixture model based approach is that the probability of a particular behavior (up-regulated or down-regulated) can be modeled and estimated for a given gene. Thus it is feasible to address how likely this gene shows a concordant behavior. In this study we develop a mixture model based method for a concordant integrative gene set enrichment analysis. Methods Concordant gene set enrichment In this study we consider multiple large-scale two-sample gene expression data sets. We use K to denote the number of these data sets and m to denote the number of common genes in these data sets. For each of these data sets we usually use a t-type test to evaluate the differential expression of each gene and a gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) method to evaluate the enrichment level of a given gene set. In order to define and evaluate a concordant gene set enrichment when an integrative analysis is conducted for all K data sets we categorize differential expression in each data set into three underlying (unobserved) representative categories: no change positive change (or up-regulated differential expression) and negative change (or down-regulated differential expression). Due to data noise what we observe from experiments may not indicate the underlying truth. (For example a gene with slight down-regulated differential expression may show a small positive t-type test value.) Although these categories are not observed in practice they can be considered in a mixture model framework. To understand the concept of concordant gene set enrichment let us consider an artificial example. Given a pathway with 30 genes we know all the underlying behavior of these genes: 20 genes have positive changes consistently among all different data sets. Furthermore if we randomly select 30 genes we also know that the expected number of genes with consistent positive changes among different data sets is just 5. In this case we would conclude that the given gene set is concordantly enriched in up-regulated differential expression (because 30 is clearly larger than 5). However in practice all the underlying differential expression categories are not observed. Instead they can be considered in a mixture model framework. Then we need to develop a mathematical formula for the probability of concordant enrichment score (CES) of a given gene set S that contains mS genes: which can be useful for prioritizing different gene sets in practice. Before we derive the mathematical formula for the above probability we need to explain the term enriched. As suggested by Efron and Tibshirani 17 unless the test statistic for a gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) considers the genome-wide background patterns (e.g. the statistics proposed in the original GSEA 7 8 ) it is necessary to consider the row randomization for genes in addition to the column permutation for samples. Therefore the term enriched means higher better than expected. Although many test statistics have been developed for GSEA with one large-scale expression data set we still need to develop a new approach for this study. The motivation is: we need to address the component information of the genes in a gene set. The component information is whether a gene is up-regulated down-regulated or non-differentially expressed. Most existing test statistics for the gene set enrichment analysis are either nonparametric or functions of z-score. But it is difficult to analyze the component information with these test statistics. Therefore based on the above discussion for the term enriched we propose the following probability for measuring concordant gene set enrichment: For a gene in a given gene set S an event of interest can be: (1) the gene is concordantly up-regulated; (2) the gene is concordantly down-regulated; or (3) the gene is concordantly differentially expressed (either up-regulated or down-regulated). Our analysis methods for these different types of enrichment analysis are almost mathematically identical. For a mathematical notation of the above CES we denote Ui the indicator that the i-th gene in gene set S satisfies the event of interest. Let D be the observed data and ? be the probability of event of interest if the gene is randomly sampled. Then we have In order to calculate CES practically we propose a three-component multivariate mixture model. In the model each component is a normal distribution. The model configuration for these three components is consistent with the differential expression categories as described above. This model is conceptually analog to a simple normal mixture approach to differential expression analysis proposed by McLachlan et al. 14 . The special feature of our model is that we focus on some specific combination of components from different dimensions. A bivariate version of this model has been used by us to evaluate the concordance and discordance between two large-scale experiments with two sample groups 15 and to integrate two microarray data sets in differential expression analysis 16 . Before the model description we need to describe the related data preprocessing and differential expression test scores as follows. Data preprocessing Because our proposed statistical method is developed based on the differential expression test scores we assume that the given gene expression data sets have been preprocessed appropriately 18 . For a concordant integrative analysis of multiple data sets we also need to select genes shared commonly by different data sets. This can be achieved using the genes' unique identifiers. Differential expression test scores For each of the two-sample gene expression data sets we screen individual genes with the traditional two-sample Student's t-test. Several modified t-tests such as SAM t-test 19 and the moderated t-test 20 have been widely used in the differential expression analysis of microarray data. These test statistics can generally improve the control of false positives by softly filtering out genes with relatively small expression variance. However we intend to consider all the genes equally important in the concordant integrative analysis of multiple data sets. Furthermore a given gene can show different levels of variance in different data sets which may make it difficult to use these modified t-tests. Therefore we still recommend the traditional two-sample t-test as the differential expression test statistic. (In practice other test statistics like SAM t-test or the moderated t-test can still be considered when there is a strong reason to do so.) Because the sample size of a high-throughput study is usually not large it is generally difficult to validate the normal distribution assumptions for the t-test. Therefore instead of the theoretical t-distribution we use the permutation procedure to compute the p-value of an observed t-test 21 . This approach has been widely adopted in the analysis of gene expression data 6 . For K two-sample gene expression data sets with m common genes we compute the one-sided upper-tailed p-value pik for gene Xi in the k-th data set i 12 . . . m and k 12 . . . K. Then we perform an inverse normal transformation to obtain a z-score: zik ?-1(1 - pik) where ?( ) is the cumulative distribution function (c.d.f.) of the standard normal distribution. This transformation has been widely used to improve the fitting of a mixture model 14 . Our proposed statistical methods for the concordant integrative analyses of multiple data sets are developed based on these sets of z-scores. A mixture model For each individual data set we assume that a mixture of three normal distributions can well fit the z-scores. Let denote the probability density function (p.d.f.) of a normal distribution with mean µ and variance ?2. Three representative components are considered for the k-th data set (k 12 . . . K): for genes non-differentially expressed (no change) for genes with up-regulated differential expression (positive change) and for genes with down-regulated differential expression (negative change). Notice that µ0k 0 and (a z-score under the null hypothesis follows the standard normal distribution because its associated p-value follows a standard uniform distribution). This configuration has been suggested in the analysis of gene expression data 14 although more components can be considered to improve the data fitting. Mathematically we have the following density function: which is a type of well-known simple normal mixture model. When the above simple model is extended to accommodate the analysis of multiple data sets we need to consider the combination of components from different dimensions (data sets). Then there are 3K different combinations. We assume that different data sets are collected independently. For the i-th gene with a list of z-scores from different data sets if we know all the related component information then the join density of these z-scores is the product of marginal densities of individual z-scores. Therefore the following formula defines our basic mixture model for a concordant analysis:1 where is the probability for this gene being in a particular combination of different components (j1 j2 . . . jK) in different data sets . We call this model a partial concordance discordance (PCD) model. Notice that a bivariate version of this model has been used to evaluate the overall concordance or discordance of two large-scale data sets and to conduct an integrative analysis of differential expression for two large-scale two-sample data sets 15 16 . Model estimation Our mixture model can be estimated by the well-developed E-M algorithm 22 . In the model the differential expression categories are considered as missing information. For any z-score vector (zi1 zi2 . . . ziK) i 12 . . . m this information can be mathematically represented as if each zik is sampled from the jk-th component (jk 0 1 or 2 and k 12 . . . K) or zero otherwise. With only the observed data the likelihood can be calculated by the following formula: where ? represents the parameter space described previously. The complete likelihood based on the observed data and missing information can be calculated by the following formula: Then we can derive the following E-step formula: We can also derive the following M-step formulas: In the E-M algorithm we iterate E-step and M-step until a numerical convergence of likelihood (not the complete likelihood). Let L(t) and L(t 1) be the likelihood values calculated after the t-th and (t 1)-th iterations respectively. A numerical convergence is claimed if L(t 1) ? L(t) 0.001. Concordant enrichment score Suppose that we are interested in gene sets with coordinate up-regulated differential expression (the CES formulas for the other events of interest can be derived similarly). Then we need to focus on the combination of different components with (j1 1 j2 1 . . . jK 1). Based on the mixture model we can derive the following probability for a gene XSi in a given gene set S XSi : i 12 . . . mS : This probability uSi can be estimated as by plugging-in the estimated parameters in the PCD model. Let hSi be either 0 or 1. Under the assumption that z-scores zik : i 12 . . . m from different genes are independent in each data set k k 12 . . . K we can calculate the concordant enrichment score (CES) for a gene set S XSi : i 12 . . . mS :2 which is the PCD model based estimate for the probability Pr(gene set S is concordantly enriched observed z-score matrix of gene set S). In the formula I(true statement) 1 and I(false statement) 0 (indicator function). Notice that the formula can be simplified to a well-known binomial tail probability if all are the same.

A surface rendered tumor-inclusive volume-of-interest in four different respiratory phases is shown in (b). Both the tumor as well as the surrounding anatomy exhibit significant deformation from phase to phase. shows motion trajectories extracted from two time series one from each patient. MRI-based monitoring over multiple respiratory cycles yields some interesting observations. In the case of Patient number 1 there is little cycle-to-cycle variation in the respiratory pattern as evidenced by the motion trajectory of the diaphragm. Furthermore the motion of the tumor centroid is well correlated with the motion of the diaphragm ((a); R2 0.99) indicating that in this case diaphragmatic motion is an appropriate surrogate for tumor motion. Finally the motion of individual points on the tumor boundary (i.e pixels comprising the edges of the tumor mass) is well correlated with that of the tumor centroid ((b); R2 0.9 to 1.0) indicating the absence of any significant rotation or deformation in the tumor mass. In the case of Patient number 2 while the respiratory pattern is quite regular (as seen from the motion trajectory of the diaphragm) the motion of the tumor centroid is very poorly correlated with diaphragmatic motion ((c); R2 0.16) and shows significant cycle-to-cycle variation. This behavior indicates that in this case diaphragmatic motion is a poor surrogate for tumor motion. Furthermore the motion of the tumor centroid is also relatively poorly correlated with that of individual points on the tumor boundary ((d); R2 0.56 to 0.94) indicating the occurrence of significant rotation deformation of the tumor mass. The complex motion observed in Patient number 2 is likely due to the proximity of tumor to the cardiac wall which almost touches the edge of the tumor ((c)) and serves as a second actuator of motion (the first being the diaphragm). These results demonstrate that the current clinical practice of using the motion of the diaphragm (or external or internal surrogates for diaphragmatic motion) has significant limitations when the tumor mass is located in the proximity of other moving structures. The goal of this work was to demonstrate the feasibility and the potential advantages of using rapid MRI as a pretreatment image-guidance tool for lung RT. These early results from rapid MRI of NSCLC patients show that for guidance-quality imaging the inherent contrast presented by the tumor mass and critical structures against the signal-poor lung parenchyma enables us to sacrifice SNR in order to achieve adequate acquisition speed to capture respiratory motion. Furthermore in the case of Patient number 2 we observe that through long-term prospective MR imaging one can capture spatiotemporal effects that are not captured by 4DCT. This is due to the fact that 4DCT projections are sorted using an external surrogate for diaphragmatic motion thereby implicitly assuming that a perfect correlation exists between diaphragmatic motion and tumor motion. The choice of a 1.5?T scanner for this work was motivated by the fact that several lung motion investigations have been performed at this field strength 12 18 . Observer studies comparing 1.5?T and 3?T scanners for lung MRI show that there is no significant difference in overall image quality 19 20 suggesting that the expected benefits of higher SNR at 3?T are somewhat mitigated due to the accompanying increase in susceptibility artifacts. Furthermore at this initial stage we chose to use existing coils and sequences. As seen from the results while this strategy was adequate for cine-2D imaging very large improvements in acquisition speed are required for truly 4D MRI. This is evidenced by the fact that even with the use of parallel acceleration 4 the acquisition time for the 4D time series shown in was 1.5?s volume. Thus there is much room for exploration of other rapid MRI sequences and for developing sequences specifically optimized for RT guidance. In particular we expect the largest improvements in imaging speed to come from strategies based on sparse sampling and reconstruction such as k-t Broad-use Linear Acquisition Speed-up Technique (k-t BLAST) and its parallel imaging version k-t SENSitivity Encoding (k-t SENSE). Beyond the current scope it is expected that the information obtained from rapid MRI (cine-2D or 4D) can be merged with that from 3DCT or 4DCT to create a fused pretreatment 4D image that combines the soft-tissue contrast and temporally dense information from MRI with the spatial accuracy and electron density information from CT. Admittedly this is a nontrivial problem because one has to account for MRI artifacts correct for geometric distortions of the anatomy due to the relatively narrow bore of the magnet and develop robust multimodality image registration tools. Furthermore since this was a feasibility study the patients were not asked to lie in the treatment position for the MRI scan. However for future studies which aim to fuse the MRI with CT patients will be required to do so. However if these challenges are addressed fused 4D images would provide a more realistic picture of the behavior of thoracic anatomy over multiple respiratory cycles. Such guidance would enable the development of novel 4D treatment planning paradigms that explicitly account for effects such as baseline shifts and changes in abdominal versus thoracic breathing. Finally several investigators are working on integrated MRI linac designs 21 23 . Online prospective 4D MRI would enable such systems to perform real-time monitoring and potentially real-time beam adaptation. 4. Conclusion We have investigated the feasibility of rapid MRI as a modality for image-based guidance in lung radiotherapy. While the acquisition speeds of cine-2D imaging are adequate for capturing most respiratory motion significant further improvements are required to achieve comparable speeds for truly 4D MRI acquisition. Nevertheless these early results indicate that rapid MRI offers a highly attractive noninvasive imaging tool for respiratory motion management. The ability to perform dose-free long-term monitoring over multiple respiratory cycles yields valuable information that is not currently available with 4DCT. We expect that such image-guidance will lay the groundwork for significantly better respiratory motion management in lung radiotherapy.

While in these studies proteins or peptides fused with Hsp70 used for immunizations in mice were shown to generate humoral or cellular immune responses we expect that fusion of anti-MSLN scFv and MTBHsp70 takes advantage of the immune-activating action of MTBHsp70 and the tumor-targeting activity of the scFv which will yield anti-tumor responses against the broadest profile of tumor antigens. We evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of this MSLN-targeted fusion protein in syngeneic mouse models of ovarian cancer and mesothelioma and examined its mechanism of action in in vitro and in vivo cross-presentation assay systems. These studies demonstrate that this bifunctional fusion protein significantly enhances survival and slows tumor growth through the augmentation of tumor-specific cell-mediated immune responses. Results Expression of scFvMTBHsp70 fusion protein and MTBHsp70 The structure of scFvMTBHsp70 is shown in Figure 1A. VH and VL from anti-MSLN P4 scFv 13 are linked using a (G4S)3 linker and fused to full length MTBHsp70 with a (G4S)3 linker in between. As shown in Figure 1B only one protein band was observed with a molecular weight of approximately 100 kDa for scFvMTBHsp70 and one protein band with a molecular weight of 70 kDa for MTBHsp70 which match the expected molecular weights of these specific proteins. Endotoxin contamination levels in scFvMTBHsp70 and MTBHsp70 were found to be very low at less than 50 EU per mg of protein. Structure and analysis of scFvMTBHsp70 fusion protein.

To confirm that the scFv portion of the fusion protein binds to MSLN on the surface of tumor cells scFvMTBHsp70 or MTBHsp70 was preincubated with 12 ?g ml recombinant human MSLN for 30 min (red line) before being added to the cells.

E scFvMTBHsp70 binds with peritoneal mesothelial cells at a low level compared to ovarian cancer and mesothelioma cells. Binding of the fusion protein is at very low or undetectable levels on PBLs and splenocytes. Thick line with incubation of scFvMTBHsp70; solid without incubation of scFvMTBHsp70. Data are representative of three independent experiments. scFvMTBHsp70 binds to BR5FVB1 ovarian cancer cells and 40L mesothelioma cells through the interaction of scFv with MSLN on the surface of tumor cells Binding of scFvMTBHsp70 or MTBHsp70 to BR5FVB1 ovarian cancer cells or 40L mesothelioma cells as determined by flow cytometry is shown in Figure 1C and D. Binding of scFvMTBHsp70 to MSLN-expressing tumor cells was almost completely inhibited by preincubation of scFvMTBHsp70 with recombinant human MSLN. Although MTBHsp70 also binds to these MSLN-expressing tumor cells the level of binding is not significantly different from background (p? ?0.187 for BR5FVB1 cells and p? ?0.086 for 40L cells). Furthermore the binding of MTBHsp70 to cancer cells cannot be blocked by recombinant MSLN. These data support the view that binding of scFvMTBHsp70 to these tumor cells occurred via the interaction of the scFv portion of the fusion protein with MSLN on the surface of tumor cells. Binding of these proteins with 40L mesothelioma cells was further compared using fluorescence microscopy. scFvMTBHsp70 shows significantly stronger binding intensity as compared to MTBHsp70 (Additional file 1: Figure S1A and B). In order to determine if scFvMTBHsp70 also binds to normal tissue in addition to tumor cells we incubated the fusion protein with peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) splenocytes or peritoneal mesothelial cells from healthy FVB NJ mice and stained the cells using the same method as was used for staining tumor cells. As shown in Figure 1E scFvMTBHsp70 binds with peritoneal mesothelial cells at a low level compared to ovarian cancer and mesothelioma cells. Binding of the fusion protein is at very low or undetectable levels on PBLs and splenocytes. Since scFvMTBHsp70 may potentially target peritoneal mesothelial cells we also explored whether it could induce inflammation in peritoneal mesothelial tissues. We injected na ve mice with saline scFvMTBHsp70 or MTBHsp70 plus P4 scFv at the same doses as those used for tumor therapy described in Method sacrificed the mice 7 days post final treatments and examined haematoxylin and eosin (H E) stained sections prepared from abdominal and intestinal peritoneum. Light microscopic examination revealed no evidence of inflammation and no infiltration of inflammatory cells such as macrophages or granulocytic cells around the mesothelial cells lining the abdominal and intestinal peritoneum of the actively treated or control animals. Representative microscopic images are shown in Additional file 2: Figure S2. scFvMTBHsp70 significantly prolongs ascites-free survival and overall survival in ovarian cancer- or mesothelioma-bearing mice To determine whether scFvMTBHsp70 can prolong survival in tumor-bearing mice we first evaluated the protein in a syngeneic mouse model of papillary ovarian cancer using immune-competent FVB NJ mice. As shown in Figure 2A scFvMTBHsp70 prolonged both ascites-free and overall survival time compared with saline or the equimolar mixture of MTBHsp70 plus P4 scFv. To further support the efficacy of this fusion protein in prolonging survival in MSLN-expressing tumor-bearing mice we evaluated this protein in a second syngeneic mouse model of mesothelioma using immune-competent C57BL 6 mice. Animals treated with scFvMTBHsp70 showed significantly prolonged ascites-free and overall survival time compared with saline- or MTBHsp70 plus P4 scFv- treated mice (Figure 2B). A and B Kaplan-Meier survival curves of tumor-bearing mice following treatment with scFvMTBHsp70 control proteins or normal saline. A In a syngeneic mouse model of papillary ovarian cancer in immune-competent FVB NJ mice scFvMTBHsp70 prolonged ascites-free survival time compared with saline (n? ?10 per group representative of two independent experiments; median survival (Med. sur.)? ?47 days vs. 37.5 days) or the mixture of MTBHsp70 plus P4 scFv (Med. sur. 39 days). scFvMTBHsp70 also prolonged overall survival time in the mice compared with saline (Med. sur. 51.5 days vs. 43 days) or the mixture of MTBHsp70 plus P4 scFv (Med. sur. 43 days). B In a syngeneic mouse model of mesothelioma in immune-competent C57BL 6 mice the fusion protein prolonged ascites-free survival time compared with saline-treated mice (n? ?20 per group pooled from two independent experiments; Med. sur. 28 days vs. 26 days) or the mixture of MTBHsp70 plus P4 scFv (Med. sur. 27 days). The fusion protein also prolonged overall survival time compared with saline (Med. sur. 36 days vs. 31 days). P values were determined using the log-rank test. p? ?0.05; p? ?0.01; p? ?0.001. scFvMTBHsp70 enhances anti-tumor CD8 T-cell responses in ovarian tumor-bearing mice To investigate whether the anti-tumor effects of scFvMTBHsp70 was associated with anti-tumor effector CD8 T-cell responses we re-stimulated splenocytes from ovarian tumor-bearing FVB mice that received different treatments with the CD8 T-cell Her2 neu epitope or MSLN Ld1 as a negative control ex vivo and analyzed the cells for production of IFN? and Granzyme B using flow cytometry. We previously showed that Her2 neu is expressed by BR5FVB1 cells 25 . Ld1 is an in-house designed H2d-restricted MSLN peptide that did not induce ovarian cancer specific T-cell response in H-2q FVB mice. We demonstrated significantly greater anti-Her2 neu CD8 T-cell responses in splenocytes from scFvMTBHsp70-treated mice compared to mice treated with saline or a simple mixture of MTBHsp70 plus P4 scFv as measured by IFN? and Granzyme B production by CD8 T cells (Figure 3A and B). This indicates that scFvMTBHsp70 enhances anti-tumor specific CD8 T-cell responses in ovarian tumor-bearing mice. However no significant difference was seen in the number of tumor-infiltrating CD8 T cells and no tumor-infiltrating Foxp3 T cells were seen in tumors from mice in different treatment groups indicating that scFvMTBHsp70 may improve effector cell function rather than the number of intratumoral CD8 T cells (Additional file 3: Figure S3A and B). Figure 3 Anti-tumor specific CD8 T-cell functions in tumor-bearing mice following different treatments. A Splenocytes harvested from mice treated with scFvMTBHsp70 fusion protein equimolar mixture of MTBHsp70 plus P4 scFv or saline (n 10 per group) were re-stimulated with Her2 neu peptide or MSLN Ld1 peptide. Results are reported as the difference between nonstimulated (media alone) and stimulated cells and expressed as the frequency of parent CD3 CD8 cells. P values were determined using One-Way ANOVA followed by Dunnett s multiple comparison tests. B Representative flow data are presented. C In vivo CD8 T-cell depletion study. FVB NJ mice were injected i.p. with anti-CD8 mAb or an isotype-matched irrelevant rat IgG2a and were treated with scFvMTBHsp70 or saline as described in the methods. CD8 T-cell depletion significantly and negatively impacted ascites-free survival in the scFvMTBHsp70 treated BR5FVB1 tumor-bearing animals compared to non depleted actively treated (n 10 per group representative of two independent experiments; Med. sur. 32.5 days vs. 48 days) animals. After CD8 T cells depletion scFvMTBHsp70 treatment did not delay onset of disease (clinically evident ascites) compared with saline (Med. sur. 32.5 days vs. 31.5 days; p 0.5938). P values were determined using log-rank test. p 0.05; p 0.01 p 0.001. scFvMTBHsp70 is able to prime an adaptive tumor-specific immune response that has an absolute requirement for tumor-specific CD8 T cells To determine whether CD8 T cells play a major role in the protective anti-tumor effects observed in mice treated with scFvMTBHsp70 we conducted in vivo CD8 T-cell depletion experiments using monoclonal antibodies. The absence of circulating CD8 cells in peripheral blood following depletion was confirmed by flow cytometry (Additional file 4: Figure S4A and B). As shown in Figure 3C CD8 T-cell depletion significantly and negatively impacted ascites-free survival in the scFvMTBHsp70-treated BR5FVB1 tumor-bearing animals compared to non-depleted actively-treated animals. Following CD8 T-cell depletion scFvMTBHsp70 treatment did not delay onset of disease (clinically evident ascites) compared to saline treatment. Therefore our data suggest that the priming of an adaptive tumor-specific immune response by scFvMTBHsp70 treatment is chiefly mediated by tumor-specific CD8 T cells. scFvMTBHsp70 stimulates maturation of murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells In order to investigate immunological mechanisms involved in the scFvMTBHsp70-enhanced anti-tumor immune response we first examined if the scFvMTBHsp70 or MTBHsp70 proteins used in our study could stimulate maturation of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) as shown in previous studies 1617 . We stimulated CD11c BMDCs with 2 ?g ml of scFvMTBHsp70 or an equimolar amount of MTBHsp70 (1.3 ?g ml). 1 ?g ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used as positive control. To determine whether the BMDC maturation was attributable to LPS contamination of the recombinant proteins used in this study we also incubated BMDCs with 0.1 ng ml LPS which was the equivalent amount of endotoxin found in 2 ?g ml scFvMTBHsp70. After a 24 h-incubation both scFvMTBHsp70 and MTBHsp70 induced DC maturation indicated by an increase in the expression of CD40 CD80 CD86 and MHC class II molecules in comparison to the control cultures in medium. The increased expression of these DC maturation markers were comparable to those on cells stimulated with 1 ?g ml LPS. The contamination control showed that addition of 0.1 ng ml LPS did not replicate the effects of scFvMTBHsp70 or MTBHsp70 allowing us to discriminate the scFvMTBHsp70- or MTBHsp70-specific effects from effects of LPS (Figure 4A and B). Figure 4 scFvMTBHsp70 induces DC maturation and promotes antigen presentation and cross-presentation. A CD11c BMDCs isolated form FVB NJ mice were incubated for 24 h with 2 ?g ml scFvMTBHsp70 1.3 ?g ml MTBHsp70 1 ?g ml LPS as positive control or 0.1 ng ml LPS as contamination control (thick lines) or medium only (solid) stained for CD11c CD40 CD80 CD86 and MHC II and analyzed by flow cytometry. Histograms were gated on CD11c DCs. Data are representative of three independent experiments in duplicate wells. B Median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of LPS- or protein-stimulated BMDCs normalized to MFI of BMDCs maintained in medium. Data are expressed as means? ?SEM in arbitrary units. P values were determined using One-Way ANOVA followed by Dunnett s multiple comparison tests. C BMDCs cultured from FVB NJ mice were pulsed with BR5FVB1 cells alone (Column a) or BR5FVB1 cells pre-complexed with MTBHsp70 (Column b) or scFvMTBHsp70 (Column c) and then incubated with BR5FVB1 tumor cell-primed T cells. Intracellular granzyme B and IFN? expressions in CD3 CD4 and CD3 CD8 T cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Data from three independent experiments in duplicate wells are pooled and analyzed using One-Way ANOVA followed by Turkey s multiple comparison tests. Data are presented as mean? ?SEM. D Representative flow data are presented. E scFvMTBHsp70 enhanced tumor cell immunogenicity in vivo. Results are reported as the difference between nonstimulated (media alone) and stimulated cells and expressed as the frequency of parent CD3 CD4 or CD3 CD8 cells. P values were determined using One-Way ANOVA followed by Turkey s multiple comparison tests. p? ?0.05; p? ?0.01; p? ?0.001; p? ?0.0001. The scFvMTBHsp70 fusion protein increases tumor antigen presentation and cross-presentation by DC in vitro In the current study we demonstrated that splenic CD8 T cells from scFvMTBHsp70-treated tumor-bearing mice could produce cytokines upon specific tumor antigen stimulation ex vivo which was associated with their antitumor therapeutic efficacy in vivo. To determine whether scFvMTBHsp70 promotes tumor specific T-cell responses by enhancing antigen presentation and cross-presentation by antigen presenting cells we co-cultured BR5FVB1 tumor cell-primed T cells with DCs that had been pulsed with BR5FVB1 tumor cells in the presence of scFv-MTBHsp70 MTBHsp70 or PBS. The scFvMTBHsp70 tumor cell-pulsed DCs induced significantly higher production of IFN-? and Granzyme B from both CD4 and CD8 tumor cell-primed T cells as compared with MTBHsp70 or PBS indicating that scFvMTBHsp70 enhances tumor antigen presentation and cross-presentation by DCs (Figure 4C and D). scFvMTBHsp70 enhances tumor cell immunogenicity in vivo Having demonstrated in vitro that scFvMTBHsp70 enhances tumor antigen presentation and cross-presentation by DCs we next explored whether scFvMTBHsp70 enhances tumor antigen presentation and cross-presentation by DCs and consequently enhances tumor cell immunogenicity in vivo. It has been demonstrated that the high density of DCs at dermal sites facilitates the capture of tumor antigens and that local inflammation induces DC maturation and migration into draining lymph nodes where they present antigens to na ve T cells generating a tumor specific immune response 26 . We primed FVB mice with an intradermal (i.d.) injection of mitomycin C-treated BR5FVB1 tumor cells followed by a booster i.d. injection of BR5FVB1 tumor cells with or without scFvMTBHsp70 or MTBhsp70. After 20 days we dissociated skin-draining lymph nodes and re-stimulated lymph node lymphocytes with Her2 neu peptides mitomycin C-treated BR5FVB1 tumor cells or BR5FVB1 tumor cell lysate and performed flow cytometric analysis for the presence of Granzyme B-generating CD4 and CD8 T cells. As shown in Figure 4E we demonstrated that Granzyme B-generating CD4 and CD8 T cells were significantly enhanced in mice that were immunized with scFv-MTBHsp70-bound tumor cells as compared to those in the mice immunized with tumor cells alone MTBHsp70-bound tumor cells or saline. Discussion We have developed a novel protein-based immunotherapy consisting of a fusion of an anti-MSLN scFv of human origin and recombinant mycobacterial heat shock protein 70 that has the ability to adjuvant significant T-cell responses against specific tumor antigens. P4 scFv directed against MSLN a surface antigen overexpressed on several types of tumor cells is used as a means of targeting the immunotherapeutic agent. We have demonstrated that this bifunctional fusion protein effectively binds BR5FVB1 ovarian cancer cells or 40L mesothelioma cells through the interaction of scFv with MSLN on the surface of tumor cells. We found that the fusion protein significantly prolonged survival time in syngeneic mouse models of papillary ovarian cancer and malignant mesothelioma. Treatment with the fusion protein induced significant tumor-specific CD8 T-cell immune responses in the splenocytes of ovarian tumor-bearing mice. Furthermore in vivo CD8 T-cell depletion studies demonstrated that this protective antitumor effect is mainly mediated by tumor-specific CD8 T cells. Treatment using a mixture of MTBHsp70 plus P4 scFv for ovarian tumor or malignant mesothelioma-bearing mice did not increase survival or enhance tumor-specific immune responses suggesting that only through fusion of the two elements is the immune system effectively activated. We also demonstrated that this approach does not induce inflammation in the abdominal or intestinal mesothelial tissues as a result of a bystander interaction with MSLN on normal mesothelial cells. Several properties of MTBHsp70 appear in this study to contribute to the generation of tumor-specific CD4 and CD8 T-cell immune responses. First it induces maturation of DCs. Although several previous studies suggested that MTBHsp70 had pro-inflammatory properties only when contaminated with LPS 2728 other studies have decisively demonstrated that MTBHsp70 alone while not LPS promotes DC maturation and innate immune responses 161729 . In our study we used a fusion protein generated from a mammalian cell expression system ensuring a minimal amount of LPS contamination. We also incubated DCs with the same amount of LPS as that found in the fusion protein and failed to replicate the effects observed with the fusion protein supporting the view that maturation of DCs can be attributed to the fusion protein rather than LPS. Secondly MTBHsp70 is capable of delivering epitopes for enhanced processing and MHC-I presentation by DCs to na ve CD8 T cells a process known as cross-presentation 30 . Mycobacterial Hsp70 fusion proteins have been shown to elicit both CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses although priming of CD8 T cells does not appear to require CD4 T cells 3132 . We demonstrated in this study that the MSLN-targeted fusion protein elicited significant tumor-specific CD8 T-cell immune responses in ovarian cancer-bearing mice and this adaptive antitumor response has an absolute requirement for tumor-specific CD8 T cells. Although at the dosing schedule used in these studies tumor-specific T-cell responses did not eventually lead to rejection of the established tumors they significantly prolonged survival time in tumor-bearing mice. DCs are believed to play a pivotal role in the initiation and programming of tumor-specific T-cell responses and are becoming an essential target in efforts to generate therapeutic immunity against cancer 33 . Two main approaches are currently under consideration for providing DCs with tumor-specific antigens. One approach is to culture patient-derived DCs ex vivo with an adjuvant that induces DC maturation in the presence of tumor specific antigens followed by adoptive transfer into the patient 33 . This approach is fraught with technical and practical difficulties such as selection of a suitable antigenic target inappropriate maturation state of selected DCs and the difficulty of generating a sufficient number of DCs ex vivo. In addition a number of investigators have recently reported that ex vivo-derived DC vaccines have an insignificant role in the direct priming of T cells in vivo 33-35 . An alternative approach to generate tumor-specific antigen bearing DCs is to induce them to take up tumor-specific antigens in vivo. It has been shown that in vivo specific targeting of tumor antigens to DCs improves the induction of antigen-specific CD4 and CD8 T-cell immunity. In these studies an agonistic anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody was used to mature DCs and eliminate antigen-specific tolerance 36-39 . MTBHsp70 has also been shown to stimulate inflammation and DC maturation via an interaction with CD40 receptors on both DCs and monocytes thus acting as an alternative ligand to CD40L 2940 . In our study we showed the fusion protein up-regulates surface expression of phenotypic markers of DC maturation. Interestingly in addition to CD80 CD86 and MHC class II molecules the expression of CD40 is also enhanced indicating a possible positive feedback loop involving CD40 signaling components. Beyond promoting DC maturation the scFvMTBHsp70 fusion protein also targets tumor cells towards the matured DCs. We propose that binding of the fusion protein with both tumor cells and DCs improves phagocytosis of parts of tumor cells by DCs and therefore any tumor antigen can be processed and loaded on both MHC class II and MHC class I molecules and presented to CD4 and CD8 T cells. This could explain the observed augmentation of tumor antigen presentation and cross-presentation brought about by the fusion protein in vitro. This may also explain the observed increased anti-Her2 neu CD8 T-cell responses in the scFvMTBHsp70-treated ovarian tumor bearing mice although Her2 neu is not directly targeted. We recapitulated these in vitro findings in an in vivo tumor cell immunogenicity study. We used the fusion protein to activate and mature DCs in the skin such as Langerhans cells. These DCs then captured tumor cells or tumor cell fragments through the connection established by the fusion protein and migrated to the draining lymphoid organs where they presented tumor antigens to na ve T cells. T cells recovered from the draining lymph node showed significantly enhanced responses to stimulation with a range of tumor antigens. Conclusion Our study provides preclinical evidence that supports a protein-based immunotherapy that induces anti-tumor immune responses which normally require dendritic cell-based approaches. The MSLN-targeted MTBHsp70 fusion protein binds MSLN on tumor cells recruits and activates APCs including DCs loads DCs in vivo with the broadest profile of naturally processed tumor antigens promotes tumor antigen presentation and cross-presentation and enhances tumor specific CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses (Figure 5). Our study supports the continued exploration of this novel fusion protein alone or in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors following conventional surgical reduction and chemotherapy for MSLN-expressing cancers. This new approach could significantly increase time to recurrence and survival in humans with ovarian cancer and mesothelioma where effective second line treatment options are very limited. Figure 5 A schematic model showing that the scFvMTBHsp70 fusion protein binds with MSLN on tumor cells and activates antigen presenting cells (APCs) thus promoting uptake of tumor cells or tumor cell fragments and promoting tumor antigen presentation and cross-presentation as well as adjuvanting tumor specific CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses. Methods Production of proteins The plasmid pQE30-MTBhsp70 that encodes full length MTBHsp70 was a generous gift from Dr. Peter Sveshnikov (Moscow Medical Academy Russia). The plasmid pTOR2-scFv that encodes an scFv fragment specific to MSLN and the recombinant P4 scFv protein 13 generated and purified from yeast were generous gifts from Dr. Nathalie Scholler (Penn Ovarian Cancer Research Center University of Pennsylvania). The DNA fragment corresponding to a 15 amino acid linker (GGGGSGGGGSGGGGS) was connected to the scFv at its C-terminal using an overlap PCR approach. The PCR product scFv-linker was subcloned into pQE30-MTBhsp70 at the N-terminal of MTBhsp70. The DNA fragment for scFvMTBhsp70 was PCR amplified and cloned into pPMY5 (Promab) downstream of a human IgG1 Fc domain and separated from the Fc region by the signal cleavage sequence for Tobacco Etch Virus protease (TEV enzyme). scFvMTBHsp70 the MSLN-targeted fusion protein was generated from HEK293 cells and purified using Protein G resin (Pierce). The Fc region of the Protein G eluted protein was then cleaved from the fusion protein by TEV enzyme (Promab) digestion. MTBHsp70 was generated using the same expression system. The production and purification of these two proteins was accomplished by Promab Biotechnologies Inc. at Richmond CA. After purification and hIgG-Fc tag removal the integrity of scFv-MTBHsp70 and MTBHsp70 were determined by SDS-PAGE followed by staining with RAPIDstain (G-Bioscience). Endotoxin contamination levels in scFvMTBHsp70 and MTBHsp70 were determined by Limulus Amebocyte Lysate Assay (LAL-assay Cambrex). Cells The BR5FVB1 ovarian cancer cells a kind gift from Dr. Orsulic in Women s Cancer Research Institute at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center 41 or 40L mesothelioma cells a kind gift from Dr. Kane in Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at Brown University 42 were maintained at 37 C in DMEM with 2 mmol L L-glutamine 10 units ml penicillin 10 ?g ml streptomycin and 10 fetal bovine serum in humidified atmosphere with 5 CO2. Cells were cultured until 80 confluent and harvested with enzyme-free cell-dissociation buffer (Gibco) for in vitro tumor cell binding assays and cross-presentation studies or harvested with Trypsin EDTA (Mediatech) for animal injections. Mouse PBLs were obtained from FVB mice via tail vein bleeds after lysis of erythrocytes using M-lyse buffer (R D systems). Small pieces of parietal peritoneal membrane were taken from the mice and digested in enzyme-free cell-dissociation buffer to obtain mouse peritoneal mesothelial cells. To test whether scFvMTBHsp70 or MTBHsp70 binds to the MSLN-expressing tumor cells or non-cancerous cells we incubated BR5FVB1 ovarian tumor cells 40L mesothelioma cells or normal cells from FVB mice including PBLs splenocytes and peritoneal mesothelial cells with 40 ?g ml scFvMTBHsp70 or 26 ?g ml MTBHsp70 followed by anti-MTBHsp70 (IgG2a) (Biodesign International) biotinylated anti-IgG2a (BD Bioscience) and Streptavidin-APC (BioLegend) and then analyzed the tumor cells by flow cytometry. As controls cells were incubated with the reagents described above except scFvMTBHsp70 or MTBHsp70. To confirm that scFv portion of the fusion protein binds to MSLN on the surface of tumor cells scFvMTBHsp70 or MTBHsp70 was preincubated with 12 ?g ml of recombinant human MSLN (R D Systems) for 30 min before adding to the cells. For fluorescence microscopy cells were cultured on coverslips until 50 confluent stained with 10 ?g ml scFvMTBHsp70 or 6.5 ?g ml MTBHsp70 followed by mouse anti-MTBHsp70 (1:500 dilution) and Donkey anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 594 (Invitrogen 1:500 dilution). Cells were observed using a Nikon Eclipse TiE fluorescence microscope. In some experiments tumor cells were treated with 20 ?g ml mitomycin C at a concentration of 5 106 ml for 1 h in a 37 C water bath and washed with complete medium at least 3 times before use. Animal models and tumor treatment Ovarian cancer was established by i.p. injection of syngeneic cancer cells BR5FVB1 (107 cells per mouse) into 6-week-old female FVB NJ mice as previously described 25 .

for pre and postsurgical treatmentthe association of scc with hpv was not confirmed because the number of cases wassmall in addition our results may not be accurate because we did not use multiplex pcrwhich is currently the most suitable genotyping method ours is the first report to show that differences in the expression form and mutations inegfr in ossn are associated with prognosis and treatmentin an animal model egfr inhibition affected epithelial cell proliferation and stratificationduring corneal epithelial wound healing and may play a role in maintaining normal cornealepithelial thickness gefitinib is an egfr inhibitor and is the first approved molecular targeted therapy for cancer treatment in japan thus understanding the pathological role of egfr in ossn andapplying it to treatment are of great significance for seeking new treatment indications inossn including conjunctival sccs in this study egfr may translocate from the cell membrane into the cytoplasm tumor cells may transfer egfr into the cytoplasm by endocytosisto avoid excessive signaling by the feedback system fig furthermore in this study theegfr mutation was present in many patients with ossn this finding may suggest a courseof treatment in the future in addition the method we used for identification of egfr mutations was not general genotyping but was a judgment of immunohistochemically

study has important limitations first regarding egfr expression on the ocular surface changes in benign diseases and agerelated changes in normal tissues may not have beensufficiently investigated our study found that egfr mutations were also present in conjunctival scc in east asians however we did not obtain results that correlated with the final prognosis further studies including further multiinstitutional studies and an increase in thenumber of cases will be needed in the future another limitation is that double testing of formalinfixed paraffinembedded specimens and plasma with realtime pcr for detection ofegfr mutations is more common than ihc in actual clinical practice according to the literature both the sensitivity and specificity were satisfactory for these two types of mutations in addition the size of our study cohort was small n and the length of followup lessthan year in some patients may not have been sufficient for longterm outcome analysestherefore additional studies will be needed to corroborate our findingsin the results of this study indicate that egfr is an active molecular target inthe pathology of ossn including scc and is a prognostic

Association of BANCR expression with patients survival Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was conducted to investigate the correlation between BANCR expression and NSCLC patient prognosis. According to relative BANCR expression in tumor tissues the 113 NSCLC patients were classified into two groups: the high BANCR group (n? ?53 fold-change???4); and the low BANCR group (n? ?60 fold-change ?4) (B). With respect to progression-free survival (PFS) this was 35.3 for the high BANCR group and 17.2 for the low BANCR group. Median survival time for the high BANCR group was 31 months and 16 months for the low BANCR group (C). The overall survival rate over 3 years for the high BANCR group was 46 and 27.5 for the low BANCR group. Median survival time for the high BANCR group was 32 months and 18 months for the low BANCR group (D). Univariate analysis identified three prognostic factors: lymph node metastasis; TNM stage; and BANCR expression level. Other clinicopathological features such as gender and age were not statistically significant prognosis factors (). Multivariate analysis of the three prognosis factors confirmed that a low BANCR expression level was an independent predictor of poor survival for NSCLC (p? ?0.031) in addition to TNM stage (p? ?0.038) ().

Histone deacetylation is involved in the downregulation of BANCR Expression levels of BANCR in NSCLC cell lines were determined by qPCR. Compared with that in 16HBE cells relative expression levels of BANCR were reduced in NSCLC cells (A). Because of the different expression patterns for BANCR in NSCLC and melanomas we investigated the mechanisms controlling tissue-specific expression of BANCR. We analyzed the promoter region of BANCR and found there were no CpG islands (data not shown). Histone protein modification was thought to play an important role in the transcription of lncRNAs; however knockdown of two core subunits of polycomb repressive complex 2 (SUZ12 and EZH2) had no influence on BANCR expression (Additional file 2: Figure S1A). Histone deacetylation is involved in BANCR downregulation. (A) BANCR expression levels of NSCLC cell lines (A549 SPC-A1 H1299 H1650 H1975 and SK-MES-1) compared with that in normal human bronchial epithelial cells (16HBE). (B) qPCR analysis of BANCR expression levels following the treatment of SPC-A1 and A549 cells with TSA. (C) qPCR analysis of HDAC2 and HDAC3 expression levels following the treatment of SPC-A1 and A549 cells with si-HDAC2 or si-HDAC3.(D E) qPCR analysis of BANCR expression levels following the treatment of SPC-A1 and A549 cells with si-HDAC1 and si-HDAC3. We observed that BANCR expression was upregulated in SPC-A1 and A549 cells following treatment with the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) (B). We sought to determine whether repression of BANCR was mediated by HDACs. Specific anti-HDAC1 and HDAC3 siRNAs were transfected into NSCLC cells and HDAC1 and HDAC3 expression was significantly decreased (C). Expression levels of BANCR were significantly upregulated in cells transfected with si-HDAC3. Transfection with the scrambled siRNA or si-HDAC1 did not induce BANCR expression (D and E). Moreover the HDAC3 expression was upregulated in NSCLC cells and negatively correlated with BANCR expression (Additional file 2: Figure S1B). Furthermore NSCLC cells were treated with RGFP966 which is an seletive inhibitor for HDAC3 with an IC50 of 0.08?M and no effective inhibition of other HDACs at concentrations up to 15?M. The results of qPCR showed that the expression of BANCR was upregulated in NSCLC cells after treated with RGFP966 when compared with control cells (Additional file 2: Figure S1C).\nLabels: [Thyroid_Cancer, Colon_Cancer, Lung_Cancer]\nReply with one label only.", "assistant": "Lung_Cancer"}
{"system": "You are a medical text classifier. Choose exactly one label.", "user": "Text: DNA methylation is an early event in bronchial carcinogenesis and increased DNA methyltransferase (DNMT)1 protein expression is a crucial step in the oncogenic transformation of epithelia. Here we investigate the role of class I histone deacetylases (HDACs) 1 3 in the stabilization of DNMT1 protein and as a potential therapeutic target for lung cancer chemoprevention. Long-term exposure of immortalized bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC-3KT) to low doses of tobacco-related carcinogens led to oncogenic transformation increased HDAC expression cell cycle independent increased DNMT1 stability and DNA hypermethylation. Overexpression of HDACs was associated with increased DNMT1 stability and knockdown of HDACs reduced DNMT1 protein levels and induced DNMT1 acetylation. This suggests a causal relationship among increased class I HDACs levels upregulation of DNMT1 protein and subsequent promoter hypermethylation. Targeting of class I HDACs with valproic acid (VPA) was associated with reduced HDAC expression and a profound reduction of DNMT1 protein level. Treatment of transformed bronchial epithelial cells with VPA resulted in reduced colony formation demethylation of the aberrantly methylated SFRP2 promoter and de-repression of SFRP2 transcription. These data suggest that inhibition of HDAC activity may reverse or prevent carcinogen induced transformation. Finally immunohistochemistry on human lung cancer specimens revealed a significant increase in DNMT1 HDAC1 HDAC2 and HDAC3 expression supporting our hypotheses that class I HDACs are mediators of DNMT1 stability. In summary our study provides evidence for an important role of class I HDACs in controlling the stability of DNMT1 and suggests that HDAC inhibition could be an attractive approach for lung cancer chemoprevention.

Background Chronic mucous hypersecretion (CMH) contributes to COPD exacerbations and increased risk for lung cancer. Because methylation of gene promoters in sputum has been shown to be associated with lung cancer risk we tested whether such methylation was more common in persons with CMH. Methods Eleven genes commonly silenced by promoter methylation in lung cancer and associated with cancer risk were selected. Methylation specific PCR (MSP) was used to profile the sputum of 900 individuals in the Lovelace Smokers Cohort (LSC). Replication was performed in 490 individuals from the Pittsburgh Lung Screening Study (PLuSS). Results CMH was significantly associated with an overall increased number of methylated genes with SULF2 methylation demonstrating the most consistent association. The association between SULF2 methylation and CMH was significantly increased in males but not in females both in the LSC and PLuSS (OR? ?2.72 95 CI? ?1.51-4.91 p? ?0.001 and OR? ?2.97 95 CI? ?1.48-5.95 p? ?0.002 respectively). Further the association between methylation and CMH was more pronounced among 139 male former smokers with persistent CMH compared to current smokers (SULF2; OR? ?3.65 95 CI? ?1.59-8.37 p? ?0.002). Conclusions These findings demonstrate that especially male former smokers with persistent CMH have markedly increased promoter methylation of lung cancer risk genes and potentially could be at increased risk for lung cancer. Methylation of gene promoters Persistent cough and phlegm Sputum DNA Former smoker Lung cancer genes Background Chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) is predicted to become the third leading cause of death worldwide by 2020 1 . Prevalence is increasing both in developing and developed countries as a result of tobacco consumption 23 environmental exposures such as pollution and biomass fuel smoke 45 and the growing elderly population 6 . Clinically COPD is defined by the presence of poorly reversible airflow obstruction although this definition simplifies the complex causes and manifestations of the disease 7 . Chronic mucous hypersecretion (CMH) characterized by persistent mucous cell metaplasia in the epithelial layer and submucosal glands of the respiratory tract is a clinically important COPD phenotype 8 . CMH leads to worse respiratory symptoms greater susceptibility to respiratory infections more frequent COPD exacerbations and increased risk of mortality 9-14 . Numerous publications and two recent meta-analyses have determined that prior CMH significantly increases the risk for later lung cancer 1516 . While smoking clearly contributes to both diseases analyses controlling for smoking have demonstrated that the association between lung cancer and prior CMH is at least partially independent of smoking 1516 . It is therefore plausible that CMH and lung cancer have some shared molecular pathology. Previous case control studies of incident lung cancer assessing the same genes as in the current study demonstrated that promoter methylation of these genes is associated with lung cancer risk 1718 . The goal of this study was to determine whether there was any association between CMH and prevalence of methylation of promoters in lung cancer-predictive genes in sputum DNA of smokers. Therefore methylation specific PCR (MSP) was used to assess promoter methylation of eleven genes in sputum samples of smokers from the Lovelace Smokers Cohort (LSC). Replication was performed in smokers from the Pittsburgh Lung Screening Study (PLuSS). Methods Study populations This study is approved by the Western Institutional Review Board (Olympia WA; 20031684) and all subjects signed informed consent for their participation. The catchment area for the LSC was the Albuquerque NM metropolitan area comprising a population of approximately 850000 persons. Inclusion criteria for entry into the current study were age 40 to 75 years current or former cigarette smoking (with a minimum of 10 pack-years) upon entry into the study and ability to understand English. The LSC disproportionately enrolled women ever-smokers to study the susceptibility to the development of smoking-related lung diseases since women are underrepresented in most such studies in the United States. Detailed characteristics of the LSC have been described elsewhere 1920 . From the LSC cohort 311 non-Hispanic white (NHW) individuals meeting the criteria for CMH were included along with 589 NHW current or former smoking controls. Current and former smoking was assessed by self-report at baseline concurrent with sputum sampling. Former smokers are those who have stopped smoking for at least 2 years prior to self-report. Study participants for the replication cohort were from the Pittsburgh Lung Screening Study (PLuSS) a volunteer cohort established to investigate lung cancer biomarkers in an at-risk population of smokers which has previously been described 2122 . From the total cohort (n? ?3638) 490 NHW individuals (183 men and 307 women) had information allowing classification with respect to chronic mucous hypersecretion and had provided sputum for DNA isolation. Spirometric testing procedures have previously been described for both the PLuSS and the LSC 1921 . Because a unifying definition for CMH was not available in both cohorts two criteria were used to define CMH: In the LSC CMH was defined as present in participants that had self-reported cough productive of phlegm for at least 3 months per year for at least 2 consecutive years (ie. the standard definition of chronic bronchitis). In the PLuSS CMH was defined as self-reported cough productive of phlegm as assessed by both a first and second questionnaire (with a median questionnaire interval of 3.5 years) and self-reported cough producing phlegm for most days a week or several days a week in the past year as assessed by the second questionnaire. Methylation specific PCR Nested MSP assays were used to detect methylation of cytosines at cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites in DNA recovered from the sputum samples as previously described 2324 . We studied the promoter methylation of a panel of eleven tumor suppressor genes with previously identified roles in predicting lung cancer risk 1718 . These genes included PCDH-20 (Protocadherin); SULF-2 (6-O-endosulfatase 2); GATA binding protein-4 and ?5 transcription factors; PAX-5? and PAX-5? (paired box protein transcription factors); p16; MGMT (O (6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase); DAPK (Death-associated protein kinase); DAL-1 (Differentially expressed in adenocarcinoma of the lung); and JPH-3 (Junctophilin). Methylation by this technique was scored positive or negative as previously described 18 . Statistical analysis Chi-square and Fisher s exact tests were used for the univariate analyses of categorical variables while two-sample t-tests and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used for continuous variables. For multivariable analyses of CMH logistic regression was performed. Predictors included gene specific methylation prevalence and also total methylation (continuous variable representing the sum of genes methylated within an individual). Additional predictors included age education (dichotomized as at least high school or less than high school education) COPD status sex pack-years smoking and current smoking status. When the LSC and PLuSS were combined for analyses adjustment for cohort was included. Model fitting iterations were performed with the R package glmulti using the small sample size corrected Akiake information criterion to determine best-fitting models 25 . All statistical analyses were performed in R version 2.12.0 or SAS version 9.2. Results CMH is associated with higher prevalence of gene promoter methylation in smokers The initial study was conducted in 900 NHW current and former smokers from the LSC with available sputum methylation data. At time of sputum collection there were 311 smokers with and 589 smokers without CMH. In unadjusted analysis prevalence of SULF2 methylation was significantly higher in those with CMH than without CMH (39 and 30 respectively p? ?0.01 Table 1). A replication study was performed in the PLuSS comprised of 140 smokers with and 350 smokers without CMH and in unadjusted analysis prevalence of SULF2 methylation was significantly higher in those with CMH than those without CMH (40 and 26 respectively p? ?0.01 Table 2).

Represents the odds ratio increase for each additional gene methylated. Analyses combining the two cohorts were also performed. In both unadjusted (Additional file 1: Table S1) and adjusted (Table 3) analysis in the combined cohorts total methylation was higher in those with CMH than in those with an absence of CMH as was methylation prevalence of SULF2 JPH3 p16 and PCDH20 (p? ?0.01 all analyses). Additional factors associated with CMH were younger age less education having COPD greater pack years and current smoking (p? ?0.01 all analyses Additional file 1: Table S1). Additional modeling was performed that included two-way interaction terms for baseline COPD pack years and methylation total or individual gene for the combined cohort of LSC and PLuSS cohorts. These interaction terms were not significant for total methylation Sulf-2 or PCDH20 each of which showed significant association with CMH within the LSC the PluSS cohort and the combination of both cohorts. These findings suggest methylation is an independent risk for CMH. The association between CMH and gene promoter methylation is stronger in males Univariate analysis revealed factors that were associated with higher methylation prevalence which include male sex (p? ?0.001) (Additional file 1: Table S2). Because of the observed sex differences in methylation prevalence sex stratified analyses were performed in males and females. Total methylation was significantly associated with CMH in males in both the LSC and PLuSS cohorts (p? ?0.01 both analyses) and when analysis was performed for the combined cohort (p? ?0.001) (Table 4). When individual genes were analyzed in males SULF2 p16 and JPH3 were significantly associated in the LSC (p? ?0.05 all analyses) while SULF2 and PCDH20 were significant in the PLuSS (p? ?0.05). In the combined cohort the prevalence of SULF2 JPH3 PCDH20 and p16 methylation were all significantly higher in males with CMH compared to males without CMH (p? ?0.05 all analyses). Although the number of female participants was higher for both cohorts in females no significant associations were found for the individual cohort analyses although higher SULF2 methylation prevalence was observed in analysis of the combined cohorts (p? ?0.05).

Introduction: In non small-cell lung cancer an exon 19 deletion and an L858R point mutation in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are predictors of a response to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors. However it is uncertain whether other uncommon EGFR mutations are associated with sensitivity to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Methods: A post-hoc analysis to assess prognostic factors was performed with the use of patients with EGFR mutations (exon 19 deletion L858R G719X and L861Q) who were treated with gefitinib in the NEJ002 study which compared gefitinib with carboplatin-paclitaxel as the first-line therapy. Results: In the NEJ002 study 225 patients with EGFR mutations received gefitinib at any treatment line. The Cox proportional hazards model indicated that performance status response to chemotherapy response to gefitinib and mutation types were significant prognostic factors. Overall survival (OS) was significantly shorter among patients with uncommon EGFR mutations (G719X or L861Q) compared with OS of those with common EGFR mutations (12 versus 28.4 months; p 0.002). In the gefitinib group (n 114) patients with uncommon EGFR mutations had a significantly shorter OS (11.9 versus 29.3 months; p 0.001). By contrast OS was similar between patients with uncommon mutations and those with common mutations in the carboplatin-paclitaxel group (n 111; 22.8 versus 28 months; p 0.358). Conclusions: The post-hoc analyses clearly demonstrated shorter survival for gefitinib-treated patients with uncommon EGFR mutations compared with the survival of those with common mutations and suggest that the first-line chemotherapy may be relatively effective for non small-cell lung cancer with uncommon EGFR mutations. Gefitinib G719X L861Q NEJ002 Uncommon epidermal growth factor receptor mutations OPEN-ACCESS TRUE The clinical efficacy of epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) such as gefitinib and erlotinib has been demonstrated in non small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients in whom standard chemotherapy has failed.12 Further studies have revealed that the presence of activating mutations in the EGFR kinase domain is strongly associated with the therapeutic efficacy of EGFR-TKIs.34 Randomized phase 3 trials have demonstrated that EGFR-TKIs significantly improve median progression-free survival (PFS) compared with platinum-doublet therapy in EGFR-mutated patients.5 8 However not all mutations in the EGFR kinase domain are responsive to EGFR-TKI treatment. These phase 3 trials have shown that EGFR-TKIs are effective for patients with common EGFR mutations such as an exon 19 deletion or the L858R point mutation which account for more than 90 of EGFR mutations. Retrospective studies and case reports suggest that some uncommon mutations are associated with sensitivity to EGFR-TKIs.9 20 These mutations include G719X in exon 18 which accounts for approximately 3 of EGFR mutations and L861Q in exon 21 which represents approximately 2 of EGFR mutations. However these uncommon EGFR mutations have not been clearly shown to be predictive markers for the efficacy of EGFR-TKIs because of their low frequency. To investigate the efficacy of gefitinib in patients with uncommon mutations we conducted a post-hoc analysis of the NEJ002 which compared gefitinib and carboplatin-paclitaxel as first-line therapies for advanced NSCLC with activating EGFR mutations. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patient Population We retrospectively analyzed the data of 225 patients who received gefitinib treatment at any point in the NEJ002 study.6 The eligibility criteria of the NEJ002 study included the presence of advanced NSCLC harboring an EGFR mutation (exon 19 deletion or L858R G719X or L861Q point mutation) without the resistant EGFR mutation T790M (identified using the peptide nucleic acid locked nucleic acid polymerase chain reaction clamp method) no history of chemotherapy an age of 75 years or younger a performance status of 0 to 1 and appropriate an function.2122 Patients provided a written informed consent. The study was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of the World Medical Association. The protocol was approved by the institutional review board of each participating institution. Treatment Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive either gefitinib (250 mg day) or paclitaxel (200 mg m2) carboplatin (area under the curve 6.0) on day 1 every 3 weeks. Chemotherapy was continued for at least three cycles. Gefitinib was administered until the disease progressed intolerable toxicities developed or consent was withdrawn. The protocol recommended that the crossover regimen be used as a second-line treatment. Clinical Assessments The antitumor response to treatment was assessed using computed tomography every 2 months. Unidirectional measurements were adopted on the basis of the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (version 1.0).23 PFS was evaluated from the date of randomization to the date when disease progression was first observed or death occurred. The treatment response and PFS were determined by an external review of computed tomography scans by experts who were not aware of the treatment assignments. Overall survival (OS) was evaluated from the date of randomization to the date of death. Statistical Analysis To assess prognostic factors for OS we used univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models. Kaplan Meier survival curves were constructed for PFS and OS and differences between groups were identified using the log-rank test. Differences in response rates were identified using Fisher s exact test. Each analysis was two sided with a 5 significance level and a 95 confidence interval. All analyses were performed using SAS for Windows software (release 9.1; SAS Institute Cary NC). RESULTS Patient Population A total of 230 chemonaive patients were enrolled in the NEJ002 study: 115 patients were assigned to receive gefitinib and 115 were assigned to receive carboplatin-paclitaxel (Fig. 1). To evaluate the efficacy of gefitinib in NSCLC patients with uncommon EGFR mutations we analyzed the data of 114 patients in the gefitinib group and 111 patients in the carboplatin-paclitaxel group. We identified five patients who had uncommon EGFR mutations in each group. Two patients who had common mutations and were treated with first-line chemotherapy consisting of carboplatin-paclitaxel were excluded from the PFS analysis in the NEJ002 study. However both were treated with gefitinib and were included in this post-hoc analysis. The demographic and disease characteristics of the patients with uncommon EGFR mutations were similar to those of patients with common EGFR mutations (). The characteristics of each patient with uncommon EGFR mutations are shown in supplementary Table S1 (Supplemental Digital Content 1 http: links.lww.com JTO A494). FIGURE 1. Enrollment randomization and follow-up of the study patients. TABLE 1. Patient Characteristics Survival Factors In the univariate analysis of 225 patients who received gefitinib at any point uncommon EGFR mutations had a significant detrimental effect on survival (). We also identified performance statuses 1 and 2 distant metastasis brain metastasis stable disease and progressive disease as significant predictors of worse prognosis for standard chemotherapy and stable disease and progressive disease as significant predictors of worse prognosis for gefitinib. When these variables were included in the Cox proportional hazards model we found that uncommon EGFR mutations performance statuses 1 and 2 stable disease and progressive disease for standard chemotherapy and stable disease and progressive disease for gefitinib had significant hazard ratios (). TABLE 2. Univariate and Multivariate Analysis by Cox Proportional Hazards Model Uncommon EGFR Mutations and Survival The Kaplan Meier curve for OS for uncommon versus common EGFR mutations is shown in A. The OS was significantly shorter among patients with uncommon EGFR mutations compared with OS of those with common EGFR mutations in the overall population (12 versus 28.4 months; p 0.002). A significantly shorter survival time was observed in patients with uncommon EGFR mutations compared with survival time in those with common EGFR mutations in the gefitinib group (11.9 versus 29.3 months; p 0.001) (Fig. 2B). However a similar survival time was observed between the subgroups of uncommon and common EGFR mutations in the carboplatin-paclitaxel group (22.8 versus 28 months; p 0.358) (Fig. 2C). FIGURE 2. The overall survival curves of patients with common mutations and uncommon mutations in the entire population (A) the gefitinib group (B) and the carboplatin-paclitaxel group (C). To examine whether the sequence of platinum doublet and gefitinib affected OS we performed a further subgroup analysis. The survival time tended to be shorter among patients receiving first-line gefitinib compared with the survival time among those receiving first-line carboplatin-paclitaxel in the uncommon EGFR mutation group (11.9 versus 22.8 months; p 0.102). Consistent with previous publications a similar survival time was observed between patients receiving first-line gefitinib and those receiving first-line carboplatin-paclitaxel in the common EGFR mutation group (29.3 versus 28 months; p 0.378). Uncommon EGFR Mutations PFS and Response In the gefitinib group the median PFS was significantly shorter for patients with uncommon EGFR mutations compared with median PFS of those with common EGFR mutations (2.2 versus 11.4 months; p 0.001) (Fig. 3A). By contrast the median PFS did not differ significantly between patients with uncommon EGFR mutations and those with common EGFR mutations in the carboplatin-paclitaxel group (5.9 versus 5.4\nLabels: [Thyroid_Cancer, Colon_Cancer, Lung_Cancer]\nReply with one label only.", "assistant": "Lung_Cancer"}

TS is the main biological target of pemetrexed. Some studies have suggested that TS expression could be a predictive factor of response in NSCLC 19 . Moreover some VNTR genotypes have been associated with TS expression and activity in other tumor types such as colorectal cancer 17 . In NSCLC patients a correlation between different genotypes and the TS protein expression has been shown 20 . Shintani et al. 20 also confirmed that the TS mRNA levels were significantly higher in lung cancer tissues with the 3R 3R genotype as compared to those with the 2R 2R genotype. Nonetheless definitive studies addressing the correlation of the different genotypes of TS in circulating genomic DNA with response to the treatment PFS or OS in pemetrexed-treated NSCLC European patients are lacking. The potential influence of the EGFR status on those polymorphisms and their correlation with clinical outcome after pemetrexed-based treatment is also unexplored. A recent study by Hu et al. 21 investigated the different TS polymorphisms in genomic DNA of 90 Asian NSCLC patients. In contrast with our findings no specific genotype regarding the TSER or 3?-UTR polymorphisms studied seemed to correlate with a significant difference in ORR PFS or OS. This could be explained by substantial clinical differences between both populations. Our cohort was constituted by Caucasian patients compared to the Asian population studied by Hu et al. In addition our patients were mostly current or former smokers (72 ) compared to the Asian population that showed 62 of never smokers. Also in our cohort the subjects mainly received pemetrexed-based chemotherapy as a first line regimen (92 ) whereas the cohort studied by Hu et al. 21 was treated with pemetrexed as a second or further line in 62.2 of the cases. These remarkable differences in basic clinical characteristics and in particular the ethnicity between both cohorts are probably also explaining the differences observed in the 3?-UTR genotype frequency between our population and the one studied by Hu et al. In our cohort 6 bp 6 bp 6 bp -6 bp and -6 bp -6 bp genotypes were found in 48 44 and 8 of the cases respectively. In contrast0.078 47.8 and 44.4 were respectively found in the population studied by Hu et al. 21 . In a previous analysis performed on another Caucasian NSCLC population evaluated at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center 22 a similar proportion of 3?-UTR genotypes according to our findings was observed (49.2 of 6 bp 6 bp 42.4 of 6 bp -6 bp and 8.4 of -6 bp -6 bp). Additionally the low prevalence of the 6 bp 6 bp genotype in an Asian population compared to our cohort may be confirmed by a recent study in which from 106 Asian NSCLC patients investigated none of them showed a 6 bp 6 bp genotype in genomic circulating DNA 23 . Nontheless in this latter study 23 a significantly higher ORR was observed among patients showing a -6 bp -6 bp 3?-UTR genotype compared to the ORR reported for patients presenting a -6 bp 6 bp polymorphism (32.2 vs 12.7 ; p ?0.008). Accordingly in our cohort a higher ORR in patients showing a -6 bp -6 bp genotype compared to those presenting a -6 bp 6 bp polymorphism was also observed (100 vs. 54.5 ). However the statistical significance was not reached probably due to the relatively low number of patients included in our analysis. Interestingly enough in the subgroup analysis of our data the 6 bp 6 bp genotype seemed to predict a higher ORR only among active former smokers compared to 6 bp -6 bp (100 vs. 50 ; p ?0.085). This novel observation if validated in future studies could be relevant for selecting specific drugs for each patient in a second or third line setting. With regards to the TSER polymorphisms the presence of a 3R 3R polymorphism seemed to predict a higher ORR with a clear trend toward statistical significance (p ?0.055). Moreover that difference was even greater and statistically significant benefiting the subpopulation of wild-type EGFR patients. To our knowledge this is the first time that such observation has been made. An interesting preclinical study by Giovannetti et al. 24 investigated the activity profile of a combination therapy against NSCLC cell lines with different genotypes with erlotinib and pemetrexed. Remarkably pemetrexed increased EGFR phosphorylation and reduced Akt phosphorylation. Additionally erlotinib significantly reduced TS expression and activity. Thus when erlotinib and pemetrexed were combined a strong synergism in all NSCLC cells regardless of their genetic signature was observed. This potential crosstalk between the EGFR signaling pathway and the TS expression and activity could in part explain our novel findings showing a significantly higher ORR to pemetrexed in those wild-type EGFR patients harboring a 3R 3R polymorphism.\nLabels: [Thyroid_Cancer, Colon_Cancer, Lung_Cancer]\nReply with one label only.", "assistant": "Lung_Cancer"}

except frs which was modestly associated with frs20 vs frs10 frs was calculated based on age total cholesterol highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol smoking status systolic blood pressure and treatment of blood pressure which are typically available in the medical records44 compared to the more sophisticated risk calculators232449 for predicting an which need variables such as physical activity red meat intake and vegetable consumption frs has relatively higher generalizability and lower recall bias a recent study has recommended the combined preventive screening and research efforts in the prevention of both cvd and cancer50 if participants with highrisk of cvd predicted by frs could be recommended to have a screening for crn which will help increase compliance and uptake of crc screening as persons who are aware of their increased risk are more likely recommendations furthermore it also maximizes the medical values of the comply with to expert information participants obtain from a clinical examination or risk assessment and thus reduces the time and costs for health carehowever there are some issues that merit our attention firstly the included studies are all crosssectional which limits the comparisons between frs and the previously developed risk prediction models for crc secondly frs has its own limitations frs only estimates 10year chd risk for all individuals years or older but not the overall cvd risk in addition it is developed based on the american population while most of study participants are asians in the included studies studies have shown that frs overestimated cvd risk in the asian cohorts51 at last the included studies tended to yield results with wide ci probably due to the limited number of participants the wider the ci the less the precision in summary higher cvd risk might trigger concurrent crc screening which should be further validated on largescale studies and future studies could consider about using the overall cvd risk score models developed from data of local cohorts to predict the risk of crcas for imaging data the association of cap or cacs with risk of ad is not strong enough that imaging index alone might not be useful for informing early detection of crn similarly routine screening with imaging modalities to predict future cardiovascular events is generally not recommended in clinical practice but use of these imaging techniques has been shown to improve cvd risk assessment and serve as a guide for initiating preventive therapies8 a high cacs can help modify the predicted risk obtained from frs alone especially among patients in the intermediaterisk category16 up to now only one risk score developed in the multiethnic study of atherosclerosis mesa study used both cacs and submit your manuscript wwwdovepresscom dovepress clinical epidemiology 0cdovepress chen traditional risk factors to predict the 10year chd risk55 inclusion of cacs in the mesa risk score offered significant improvements in risk prediction cstatistic vs p factors in the risk models like smoking behaviors and blood lipids are closely related to the incidence and progression of cvd but they are not direct markers of current status of atherosclerosis this might help explain why the performance of risk models is improved by adding markers with anatomical delineation through imaging technology accounting for the higher performance of the combined use of risk scores and imaging tools on cvd risk assessment further studies could consider about exploring the association of combined form of them with the risk of crcwe also observed that less than half of included studies reported the associations of cvd risk with both risk of an and ad2829384243 colonoscopy is considered to as a valid primary screening tool for crc and is able to detect both ad and an the lower prevalence of an and the limited number of participants in several included studies might limit the power to explore the relation of an with cvd risk which could partly explain why most of studies did not include an as outcome therefore the findings should be carefully interpreted and further validated on largescale studiesour study has some strengths comprehensive search strategies along with welldefined eligibility criteria were used to help identify relevant s in addition two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in the included studies however several limitations should also be addressed firstly the current meta analysis was based on observational studies there were the possibilities of potential effects of unknown or residual confounding factors on our results secondly as we only considered about established cvd risk models and recommended imaging modalities the potential of other cvd risk assessment index on the detection of crn was not summarized and compared in this study however it is also reasonable to just include these methods since their feasibility and performance for cvd risk prediction have been well approved in the clinical practice thirdly cut off values and group comparisons for the same cvd risk assessment method varied in the included studies which limits the synthesis of results for example the cut off values for cacs are the tertiles of cacs in the study by kim 40 however cacs was categorized into three groups with cut off values at and in the other studies3233 therefore less studies were included in the metaanalysis which might influence the accuracy of the pooled results lastly most of studies were conducted in asian populations which is an inherent limitation of the included studies thus our findings might not be applicable to other populations and needs to be externally validated in racially diverse populationsconclusionsto our knowledge this is the first review that applies metaanalyses to determining the overall association of recommended cv risk assessment methods with the risk of crn in the asymptomatic population frs calculated based on shared risk factors of cvd and crc shows potential to help identify subgroups at increased risk for an whether the combination of frs and imaging index is useful for the optimal evaluation of crn risk remains to be solved in the future studies cvd risk might inform crc screening which needs more research in the future to validate its feasibility and

caco2 cell line derived from colorectal cancer is widely used as an intestinalmodel to assess drug membrane permeability however because the expression of major drugmetabolizingenzymes such as cytochrome p450 cyp is extremely low in caco2 cells it is difficult to predict intestinalmetabolism which is a significant factor in predicting oral drug bioavailability previously we constructed a mouseartificial chromosome vector carrying the cyp cyp2c9 cyp2c19 cyp2d6 and cyp3a4 and p450 oxidoreductasepor 4cypsmac genes and increased cyp expression and metabolic activity in hepg2 cells via transfer of thisvectorresults in the current study to improve the caco2 cell assay model by taking metabolism into account weattempted to increase cyp expression by transferring the 4cypsmac into caco2 cells the caco2 cells carryingthe 4cypsmac showed higher cyp mrna expression and activity in addition high metabolic activity availabilityfor permeation test and the potential to assess drug drug interactions were confirmeds the established caco2 cells with the 4cypsmac are expected to enable more accurate prediction ofthe absorption and metabolism in the human intestine than parental

often limited bymetabolizing enzymes and efflux transporters in the gut the caco2 cell line derived from human colon carcinoma is a commonly used model for estimating the intestinal absorption of new drug candidates althoughcaco2 cells express a variety of efflux and uptake transporters they have an absence or low levels of cytochrome p450 cyp isoforms such as cyp3a4 andcyp2c that are typically expressed in the human intestinal epithelium therefore caco2 cells are of limited use in evaluating the role of metabolism inintestinal absorption after oral administration to predict the intestinal absorption of drugs more accurately itis necessary to modify caco2 cells to increase their expression of cyp isoformssome studies reported that cyp3amediated metabolism in caco2 cells was enhanced by transfection withboth cyp3a4 and cyp oxidoreductase por treatment with 1Î 25dihydroxyvitamin d3 or the combination of transfection with cyp3a4 and treatment withboth sodium butyrate and 12otetradecanoylphorbol13acetate in contrast few studies aimed at enhancingmultiple cyp isoforms in caco2 cells have been performed honkakoski and his collaborators created caco2cell lines expressing nuclear receptors pregnane x receptor and constitutive androstane receptor thesenuclear receptors upregulated the expression of somecyp isoforms in caco2 cells but cyp activities remainedvery low in the absence of 1Î 25dihydroxyvitamin d3therefore a new approach is needed to introduce multiple cyp isoforms in caco2 cellsmammalian artificial chromosome ac vectors derived from native chromosomes have several advantagesover conventional vectors acs segregate freelyfrom host chromosomes through a set of cell divisionsand are adapted to carry multiple target genes with a desired copy number and mbsized genomic regions withendogenous regulatory elements furthermore acs carrying genes of interest can be transferred into varioustarget celllines via microcellmediated chromosometransfer mmct considering these advantages acshave been used to generate several model cells for pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic studies previously a lack of cyp3a4 expression in the caco2cell line was addressed through the introduction of exogenous cyp3a4 and por which is a coenzyme ofcyps via a human artificial chromosome hac vectorderived from human chromosome the haccarrying cyp3a4 and por genes conferred sufficientcyp3a activity to parental caco2 cells to be useful forpredicting the intestinal extraction ratio in humansrecently a mouse artificial chromosome mac vectorconstructed from native mouse chromosome wasused to increase the activity of multiple cyps in hepg2cells which are a liver cancer cell line typically exhibiting low cyp activity in this study four cyp genescyp3a4 cyp2c9 cyp2c19 cyp2d6 and a pene were loaded on the mac 4cypsmac and transferred to hepg2 cells tchepg2 to make the cellsmore suitable as a model to evaluate drug drug interactions ddis and hepatotoxicity in the initial screeningof candidate drugs the expression and activity ofcyps in tchepg2 were comparable to those in humanhepatocytes and this expression was sustained after along culture period because of the stability of the macin human cells regarding the assessment of ddisthe activity of cyps in tchepg2 was reduced in a concentration and timedependent manner by specific inhibitors which reflects the conditions in primary humanhepatocytes furthermore metabolic toxicity of aflatoxinb1 which is converted to its active metabolite viacyp3a4 and exerts hepatotoxicity through dna damage was clearly recapitulated in tchepg2 cells rather than parental hepg2 cells this study suggestedthat tchepg2 can provide a useful model to assess notonly hepatic metabolism but also cypmediated hepatotoxicity during the early stages of drug development andthe system using the mac can improve the existingcellbased modelin the current study we aimed to utilize previouslyconstructed 4cypsmac to generate a novel caco2 cellline with increased activity of multiple major cyps the4cypsmac was transferred to caco2 cells via mmctto establish caco2 cells carrying the 4cypsmac andthe caco2 4cypsmac cells were

the gene expression level was particularlyhigh in the caco2 4cypsmac and caco2 4cypsmac clones fig among the introduced genespor expression was only slightly enhanced in theseclones basal expression of por in parental caco2 cells ishigh as observed in a previous study caco2 4cypsmac showed high expression of the majority of genescompared with caco2 4cypsmac the caco2 cellline consists of a heterogeneous population of cells therefore difference of the gene expression levels between obtained clones may partly depend on the population into which the 4cypsmac has been introducedalthough the other two clones obtained by mmct stillshowed higher expression levels than the parental caco2cells the level of increase was moderate therefore we selected caco2 4cypsmac and caco2 4cypsmac clones

thepermeation test for cyp3a4 inhibition of cyp3a4 s function by ketoconazole in caco2 4cypsmac cells was alsoconfirmed this suggests that the established cells could beused for ddi testing of drugs

deviation from nice colorectal cancercrc guidelines may lead to significantly poorer outcomes however the current model of cancer services delivery cannot be maintained because of both resource limitation and the potential risksto patients and staff during the pandemic there is a lack of highdependency beds which are being utilized for covid19 patientsthere is the risk of exposing colorectal cancer patients the majority of whom are elderly and have significant comorbidities to thevirus during their treatment within the hospital patients requiringneoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy are at particular risk finallystaff safety must also be considered particularly around aerosolgenerating procedures such as endoscopy and laparoscopic surgery intercollegiate general surgery guidance on covid19 outlinedgeneral principles on the provision of a safe surgical service duringthe pandemic however there has been no speciï c guidance todate on how to best modify colorectal cancer crc service provision during the pandemic in the absence of a national consensusthe onus is on individual hospital trusts and multidisciplinaryteams to make very challenging decisions about individual patientcare lack of a uniï ed approach may have important consequencesat patient and healthcare institution levelsdelay in cancer diagnosis or treatment due to service modiï cation is likely to create an

of the nhs and internationalhealth care systems the pandemic has shifted this focus awayfrom the cancer services colorectal cancer patients are particularly 0ca courtney international of surgery protocols vulnerable to the disruption of their care as diagnosis throughendoscopy was stopped due to concerns about virus aerosolysation this study is important because it is the ï rst study to ask

The identification of recurrent gene rearrangements in the clinical laboratory is the cornerstone for risk stratification and treatment decisions in many malignant tumors. Studies have reported that targeted next-generation sequencing assays have the potential to identify such rearrangements; however their utility in the clinical laboratory is unknown. We examine the sensitivity and specificity of ALK and KMT2A (MLL) rearrangement detection by next-generation sequencing in the clinical laboratory. We analyzed a series of seven ALK rearranged cancers six KMT2A rearranged leukemias and 77 ALK KMT2A rearrangement negative cancers previously tested by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Rearrangement detection was tested using publicly available software tools including Breakdancer ClusterFAST CREST and Hydra. Using Breakdancer and ClusterFAST we detected ALK rearrangements in seven of seven FISH-positive cases and KMT2A rearrangements in six of six FISH-positive cases. Among the 77 ALK KMT2A FISH-negative cases no false-positive identifications were made by Breakdancer or ClusterFAST. Further we identified one ALK rearranged case with a noncanonical intron 16 breakpoint which is likely to affect its response to targeted inhibitors. We report that clinically relevant chromosomal rearrangements can be detected from targeted gene panel based next-generation sequencing with sensitivity and specificity equivalent to that of FISH while providing finer-scale information and increased efficiency for molecular oncology testing.

Cycle-to-cycle variations in respiratory motion can cause significant geometric and dosimetric errors in the administration of lung cancer radiation therapy. A common limitation of the current strategies for motion management is that they assume a constant reproducible respiratory cycle. In this work we investigate the feasibility of using rapid MRI for providing long-term imaging of the thorax in order to better capture cycle-to-cycle variations. Two nonsmall-cell lung cancer patients were imaged (free-breathing no extrinsic contrast and 1.5?T scanner). A balanced steady-state-free-precession (b-SSFP) sequence was used to acquire cine-2D and cine-3D (4D) images. In the case of Patient 1 (right midlobe lesion 40?mm diameter) tumor motion was well correlated with diaphragmatic motion. In the case of Patient 2 (left upper-lobe lesion 60?mm diameter) tumor motion was poorly correlated with diaphragmatic motion. Furthermore the motion of the tumor centroid was poorly correlated with the motion of individual points on the tumor boundary indicating significant rotation and or deformation. These studies indicate that image quality and acquisition speed of cine-2D MRI were adequate for motion monitoring. However significant improvements are required to achieve comparable speeds for truly 4D MRI. Despite several challenges rapid MRI offers a feasible and attractive tool for noninvasive long-term motion monitoring. 1. Introduction Respiratory motion causes significant uncertainties in tumor delineation radiotherapy (RT) dose calculations and delivery particularly in the case of thoracic tumors (e.g. lung liver) 1 . The management of respiratory motion has been an active area of research over the last decade. Several investigational as well as clinically implemented respiratory motion management strategies have been described in the literature 1 . However a common limitation of most of these strategies is that they rely on image-guidance techniques that make simplifying assumptions about respiratory motion and do not adequately capture cycle-to-cycle variations which invariably occur in all patients. Modern motion-managed radiotherapy typically uses four-dimensional computed tomography (4DCT) as the tool of choice for pretreatment anatomic imaging (also termed as CT simulation or CT-sim in the literature). In this technique Lung_Cancer CT projections are acquired over several respiratory cycles from successive slabs in the body. At the same time an external surrogate (e.g. an optical marker) records the amplitude of respiration. Based on the surrogate motion trace the reconstructed slices are sorted into 6 10 volumes over a single respiratory average cycle where each volume represents a specific phase of respiration (inhalation through exhalation) 2 4 . This retrospectively reconstructed movie of a single respiratory cycle serves as the anatomical ground truth for all subsequent stages of radiotherapy (contouring treatment planning and dose delivery). It is well recognized however that respiratory motion is far more complex than can be characterized by a single average cycle. Cycle-to-cycle variations such as baseline shifts and changes in the amplitude and or frequency of the respiratory waveform are inadequately accounted for in 4DCT-based planning and can lead to significant geometric and therefore dosimetric errors 5 . Furthermore binning CT projection data acquired over several cycles into a single cycle leads to severe image artifacts. For example Yamamoto et al. found that 45 of 50 patients had at least one artifact with mean magnitude of 11.6?mm (range: 4.4 56.0?mm) 6 . In a separate study Persson et al. found that 4DCT artifacts caused significant uncertainties in the delineation of the gross tumor volume (GTV) in 16 out of 19 patients 7 . Finally the equivalent dose for 4DCT is quite high (29 40?mSv) about 4 times higher than that for 3DCT (3 10?mSv) 8 . Such high imaging dose discourages long-term monitoring and frequent imaging. Due to these limitations 4DCT-based image guidance provides an incomplete picture of respiration-induced spatial and temporal changes in the thoracic anatomy. The aim of this work is to investigate the feasibility of using rapid magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a nonionizing imaging modality to capture long-term and or frequent information about respiratory motion and its effects on the movement and deformation of lung tumors and surrounding critical ans. The fundamental difference and therefore advantage of cine MRI are that unlike 4DCT the MR image (i.e. slice or volume) is acquired prospectively thereby capturing an actual instance of the patient anatomy which is closer to reality compared to an average estimate of the anatomical state that is represented by 4DCT. Prospective acquisition also enables MRI to overcome the two main challenges that limit the utility of 4DCT images namely the ability to capture cycle-to-cycle variations and elimination of binning-related image artifacts. In addition due to the fact that MRI does not involve ionizing radiation there is no dose penalty for repeated imaging (as opposed to 4DCT). The use of rapid cine-2D as well as 4D MRI for radiotherapy guidance has been previously reported in the literature. In cine-2D MRI a slice of the anatomy is selected at arbitrary orientation and imaged repeatedly in time. 4D MRI is conceptually similar except that in this case an entire volume is selected and imaged. Plathow et al. have reported cine-2D imaging of lung cancer patients at 3 frames per second (fps) 9 and 4D imaging of malignant pleural mesothelioma patients at 1 volume s 10 under slow-breathing conditions using a 1.5?T scanner. Von Siebenthal et al. have reported on a 4D MR imaging technique using retrospective stacking of cine-2D slices 11 . Biederer et al. report 4D MRI of a ventilated chest phantom that uses porcine lung with embedded agarose nodules to simulate tumors 12 . More recently Cai et al. have reported a 4D MRI study of a moving phantom using a technique that uses retrospective sorting of cine-2D slices 13 . To our knowledge there has been no systematic study of rapid lung MRI in the context of image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) motion management under realistic (prospective acquisition free-breathing human subjects) conditions. In this work we present a pilot investigation of prospective rapid cine-2D and cine-3D (commonly termed as 4D in radiotherapy and the MRI literature) MRI of two nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients under free-breathing conditions without externally administered contrast. Subsequently we compute and analyze the motion trajectories of tumors and structures of interest. Our current goal is to demonstrate the feasibility and the utility of rapid MR imaging to monitor respiratory motion over multiple cycles and obtain guidance information about the motion deformation and the interplay between lung tumors and surrounding critical ans. Our long-term goal (beyond the current scope) is to use the information obtained from rapid MRI to augment and potentially correct 4DCT images. 2. Methods 2.1. Imaging of NSCLC Patients Two NSCLC patients were imaged following informed consent. Patient number 1 was a 67-year old female with an 40?mm diameter right midlobe tumor. Patient number 2 was an 80-year old male with an 60?mm diameter left upper-lobe tumor. Both patients were scanned on a 1.5?T scanner (GE Signa). Both patients were scanned in the supine position under free-breathing conditions and without externally administered contrast. For each patient a 4-channel cardiac coil was centered around the tumor. cine-2D time series in the coronal and sagittal planes were acquired using a balanced steady-state free precession (b-SSFP) sequence and the images were reconstructed using the vendor's in-built software. In all cases except one (Patient number 1 coronal series) half-Fourier acquisition was used in order to achieve higher imaging speed. In the case of Patient number 2 an additional 3D t (4D) scan of a tumor-inclusive coronal slab (8 slices each 5?mm thick) was acquired using the b-SSFP sequence in the 3D mode and in conjunction with parallel imaging (acceleration 4). The 4D images were reconstructed using the autocalibrating reconstruction for Cartesian imaging (ARC) algorithm 14 . Table 1 summarizes the image acquisition parameters for the cine-2D and the 4D acquisitions. 2.2. Motion Analysis For each time series from Table 1 the motion trajectories of the tumor and structures of interest were determined as follows. A fluid-flow-based deformable image registration previously validated for RT applications 15 17 was applied to each time series to compute deformation vector fields (DVFs) across the temporal dimension. In order to reduce errors and achieve high computation speed (i.e. fewer iterations) the registration was performed in two stages-rigid registration which accounted for gross translation and affine transformations of the tumor and ans followed by deformable registration which accounted mainly for tumor and an deformation. For each time series a reference image was selected (typically at mid-inhale) and 15 points each on the tumor boundary and the diaphragm were manually selected. Subsequently the motion trajectory of each pixel on a contour was determined from the DVFs. The validity of using diaphragmatic motion as a surrogate for tumor motion was examined by calculating the correlation between the average motion trajectory of the pixels comprising the diaphragm boundary with the average trajectory of the pixels comprising the tumor boundary. The presence of complex motion such as tumor rotation and or deformation was tested by comparing the motion trajectory of the tumor centroid with those of the selected points on the tumor boundary. 3. Results and Discussion Figure 1 shows MR images acquired from Patient number 1 (Figures 1(a) and 1(b)) and Patient number 2 (Figures 1(c) and 1(d)). The acquisition times per image ranged from 0.15 to 0.27?s speeds adequate for monitoring most respiratory motion. In each case the tumor mass (indicated by an arrow) can be clearly delineated against the background of lung parenchyma.\nLabels: [Thyroid_Cancer, Colon_Cancer, Lung_Cancer]\nReply with one label only.", "assistant": "Lung_Cancer"}

normal female reproductive tract showed that pax8 was expressed in the endometrial endocervical and ovarian epithelial cells as well as in nonciliated epithelial cells of the fallopian tubes this study investigated the immunohistochemical expression of pax8 in sudanese patients who were diagnosed with female reproductive tract cancers patients on the 5th decade of life were constituting half of the study participants with no statistically significant association between age group and the type of cancer however previous studies had suggested other risk factors which could contribute in the development of certain gynecological cancer regarding the place of residence the majority of patients coming from western sudan this result is in contrary with a previous study in sudan conducted by saeed et a0al in which they showed that the percentage of patients suffering from different types of cancers residing in central and northern sudan were higher compared to the other regions in sudan nevertheless these findings could suggest the involvement of environmental risk factors however the limited study samples size is insufficient to support this suggestion therefore further research with a larger samples size investigating the potential environmental risk factors is essential for strategic prevention and protection measuresthe reported number of female patients with cervical cancer was high compared to ovarian and endometrium cancer similar results were seen previously among sudanese females also the high frequency of stages 3b and 2b compared to the other stages were comparable to previous study conducted in sudan this similarity underscores a delayed response among sudanese females in seeking healthcare and urge the need for health promotion and education to encourage young sudanese females for the early signs detection and seeking healthcare as early as possible for a better treatmentregarding the classification based on the histopathological diagnosis most of the female diagnosed with scc this result was also similar to previous study investigated the prevalence of the different gynecologic cancer in sudan however the expression of pax8 among the studied samples was relatively low compared to previous studies this could be attributed 0cali a0et a0al bmc res notes page of to the site of cancer development while agrees with another study where pax8 was expressed only in patient interestingly a high frequency of pax8 expression was noted among females diagnosed with endometrium cancer compared to scc this finding is in contrary with a previous report where pax8 was expressed among only of the studied samples also the result was strongly in accordance with other studies besides that the lack of pax8 expression among those who were diagnosed with well differentiated scc and metastatic adenocarcinoma could play a significant role in either gynecologic cancer differentiation or in detection of endometrium adenocarcinoma progression to metastatic adenocarcinoma conclusionalthough pax8 showed a significant expression among adenocarcinomas lesions and negative expression was noted among those with well differentiated scc and metastatic adenocarcinoma pax8 might not be beneficial when used alone as a diagnostic marker for the tumors that occur in the female reproductive tractlimitations the small sample size investigated in this study reduced the ability of using the expression of pax8 as a diagnostic marker therefore a largescale study is needed and it should include other types of malignant tumors

To determine whether scFvMTBHsp70 promotes tumor specific T-cell responses by enhancing antigen presentation and cross-presentation by antigen presenting cells we co-cultured BR5FVB1 tumor cell-primed T cells with DCs that had been pulsed with BR5FVB1 tumor cells in the presence of scFv-MTBHsp70 MTBHsp70 or PBS. The scFvMTBHsp70 tumor cell-pulsed DCs induced significantly higher production of IFN-? and Granzyme B from both CD4 and CD8 tumor cell-primed T cells as compared with MTBHsp70 or PBS indicating that scFvMTBHsp70 enhances tumor antigen presentation and cross-presentation by DCs (Figure 4C and D). scFvMTBHsp70 enhances tumor cell immunogenicity in vivo Having demonstrated in vitro that scFvMTBHsp70 enhances tumor antigen presentation and cross-presentation by DCs we next explored whether scFvMTBHsp70 enhances tumor antigen presentation and cross-presentation by DCs and consequently enhances tumor cell immunogenicity in vivo. It has been demonstrated that the high density of DCs at dermal sites facilitates the capture of tumor antigens and that local inflammation induces DC maturation and migration into draining lymph nodes where they present antigens to na ve T cells generating a tumor specific immune response 26 . We primed FVB mice with an intradermal (i.d.) injection of mitomycin C-treated BR5FVB1 tumor cells followed by a booster i.d. injection of BR5FVB1 tumor cells with or without scFvMTBHsp70 or MTBhsp70. After 20 days we dissociated skin-draining lymph nodes and re-stimulated lymph node lymphocytes with Her2 neu peptides mitomycin C-treated BR5FVB1 tumor cells or BR5FVB1 tumor cell lysate and performed flow cytometric analysis for the presence of Granzyme B-generating CD4 and CD8 T cells. As shown in Figure 4E we demonstrated that Granzyme B-generating CD4 and CD8 T cells were significantly enhanced in mice that were immunized with scFv-MTBHsp70-bound tumor cells as compared to those in the mice immunized with tumor cells alone MTBHsp70-bound tumor cells or saline. Discussion We have developed a novel protein-based immunotherapy consisting of a fusion of an anti-MSLN scFv of human origin and recombinant mycobacterial heat shock protein 70 that has the ability to adjuvant significant T-cell responses against specific tumor antigens. P4 scFv directed against MSLN a surface antigen overexpressed on several types of tumor cells is used as a means of targeting the immunotherapeutic agent. We have demonstrated that this bifunctional fusion protein effectively binds BR5FVB1 ovarian cancer cells or 40L mesothelioma cells through the interaction of scFv with MSLN on the surface of tumor cells. We found that the fusion protein significantly prolonged survival time in syngeneic mouse models of papillary ovarian cancer and malignant mesothelioma. Treatment with the fusion protein induced significant tumor-specific CD8 T-cell immune responses in the splenocytes of ovarian tumor-bearing mice. Furthermore in vivo CD8 T-cell depletion studies demonstrated that this protective antitumor effect is mainly mediated by tumor-specific CD8 T cells. Treatment using a mixture of MTBHsp70 plus P4 scFv for ovarian tumor or malignant mesothelioma-bearing mice did not increase survival or enhance tumor-specific immune responses suggesting that only through fusion of the two elements is the immune system effectively activated. We also demonstrated that this approach does not induce inflammation in the abdominal or intestinal mesothelial tissues as a result of a bystander interaction with MSLN on normal mesothelial cells. Several properties of MTBHsp70 appear in this study to contribute to the generation of tumor-specific CD4 and CD8 T-cell immune responses. First it induces maturation of DCs. Although several previous studies suggested that MTBHsp70 had pro-inflammatory properties only when contaminated with LPS 2728 other studies have decisively demonstrated that MTBHsp70 alone while not LPS promotes DC maturation and innate immune responses 161729 . In our study we used a fusion protein generated from a mammalian cell expression system ensuring a minimal amount of LPS contamination. We also incubated DCs with the same amount of LPS as that found in the fusion protein and failed to replicate the effects observed with the fusion protein supporting the view that maturation of DCs can be attributed to the fusion protein rather than LPS. Secondly MTBHsp70 is capable of delivering epitopes for enhanced processing and MHC-I presentation by DCs to na ve CD8 T cells a process known as cross-presentation 30 . Mycobacterial Hsp70 fusion proteins have been shown to elicit both CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses although priming of CD8 T cells does not appear to require CD4 T cells 3132 . We demonstrated in this study that the MSLN-targeted fusion protein elicited significant tumor-specific CD8 T-cell immune responses in ovarian cancer-bearing mice and this adaptive antitumor response has an absolute requirement for tumor-specific CD8 T cells. Although at the dosing schedule used in these studies tumor-specific T-cell responses did not eventually lead to rejection of the established tumors they significantly prolonged survival time in tumor-bearing mice. DCs are believed to play a pivotal role in the initiation and programming of tumor-specific T-cell responses and are becoming an essential target in efforts to generate therapeutic immunity against cancer 33 . Two main approaches are currently under consideration for providing DCs with tumor-specific antigens. One approach is to culture patient-derived DCs ex vivo with an adjuvant that induces DC maturation in the presence of tumor specific antigens followed by adoptive transfer into the patient 33 . This approach is fraught with technical and practical difficulties such as selection of a suitable antigenic target inappropriate maturation state of selected DCs and the difficulty of generating a sufficient number of DCs ex vivo. In addition a number of investigators have recently reported that ex vivo-derived DC vaccines have an insignificant role in the direct priming of T cells in vivo 33-35 . An alternative approach to generate tumor-specific antigen bearing DCs is to induce them to take up tumor-specific antigens in vivo. It has been shown that in vivo specific targeting of tumor antigens to DCs improves the induction of antigen-specific CD4 and CD8 T-cell immunity. In these studies an agonistic anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody was used to mature DCs and eliminate antigen-specific tolerance 36-39 . MTBHsp70 has also been shown to stimulate inflammation and DC maturation via an interaction with CD40 receptors on both DCs and monocytes thus acting as an alternative ligand to CD40L 2940 . In our study we showed the fusion protein up-regulates surface expression of phenotypic markers of DC maturation. Interestingly in addition to CD80 CD86 and MHC class II molecules the expression of CD40 is also enhanced indicating a possible positive feedback loop involving CD40 signaling components. Beyond promoting DC maturation the scFvMTBHsp70 fusion protein also targets tumor cells towards the matured DCs. We propose that binding of the fusion protein with both tumor cells and DCs improves phagocytosis of parts of tumor cells by DCs and therefore any tumor antigen can be processed and loaded on both MHC class II and MHC class I molecules and presented to CD4 and CD8 T cells. This could explain the observed augmentation of tumor antigen presentation and cross-presentation brought about by the fusion protein in vitro. This may also explain the observed increased anti-Her2 neu CD8 T-cell responses in the scFvMTBHsp70-treated ovarian tumor bearing mice although Her2 neu is not directly targeted. We recapitulated these in vitro findings in an in vivo tumor cell immunogenicity study. We used the fusion protein to activate and mature DCs in the skin such as Langerhans cells. These DCs then captured tumor cells or tumor cell fragments through the connection established by the fusion protein and migrated to the draining lymphoid organs where they presented tumor antigens to na ve T cells. T cells recovered from the draining lymph node showed significantly enhanced responses to stimulation with a range of tumor antigens. Conclusion Our study provides preclinical evidence that supports a protein-based immunotherapy that induces anti-tumor immune responses which normally require dendritic cell-based approaches. The MSLN-targeted MTBHsp70 fusion protein binds MSLN on tumor cells recruits and activates APCs including DCs loads DCs in vivo with the broadest profile of naturally processed tumor antigens promotes tumor antigen presentation and cross-presentation and enhances tumor specific CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses (Figure 5). Our study supports the continued exploration of this novel fusion protein alone or in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors following conventional surgical reduction and chemotherapy for MSLN-expressing cancers. This new approach could significantly increase time to recurrence and survival in humans with ovarian cancer and mesothelioma where effective second line treatment options are very limited. Figure 5 A schematic model showing that the scFvMTBHsp70 fusion protein binds with MSLN on tumor cells and activates antigen presenting cells (APCs) thus promoting uptake of tumor cells or tumor cell fragments and promoting tumor antigen presentation and cross-presentation as well as adjuvanting tumor specific CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses.

identified multiple expressedcircrnas in breast cancer samples and observed averagehigher abundance of circrnas over their host genes inperipheral blood than tissues which might contribute tothe exploration of diagnostic biomarkerfor breastcancer we then identified that circsmarca5 is significantly decreased in breast cancer tissues using rnaseqmore importantly we define a critical role for circsmarca5 in the regulation of dna damage repaircapacity and the drug sensitivity of breast cancer cellsin vitro and in vivo through the negative regulation ofits parent gene smarca5 these findings are of highclinical relevance because chemotherapy with cisplatinand bleomycin remains the standard of care in breastcancer hence the restoration of circsmarca5levels provides an approach to overcome

downregulation of smarca5 and theeffect of circsmarca5 overexpression on dna repaircapacity was reversed by concomitant smarca5 overexpression suggesting that the effect of circsmarca5on dna repair capacity is mediated through smarca5circrnas exert functions in various ways such as forming an rloop with dna to regulate splicing and transcriptional pausing for example circsepallata3regulates the splicing of its parent mrna through rloop formation in addition circrnas are a novelclass of cernas that sponge mirnas thus positivelyregulating gene expression additionally circrnas such as exonintron circrnas regulate geneexpression through specific rnarna interactions withu1 snrna furthermore circrnas also exertfunctions by binding to proteins and regulating theiractivities we

{"system": "You are a medical text classifier. Choose exactly one label.", "user": "Text: The protein encoded by DSC3 is a calcium-dependent glycoprotein (Desmocollin 3) that is required for cell adhesion and desmosome formation. The protein encoded by PKP1 may be involved in molecular recruitment and stabilization during desmosome formation. The protein encoded by CLCA2 belongs to the calcium sensitive chloride conductance protein family. It may serve as adhesion molecule for lung metastatic cancer cells. The above four genes (DSC3 DSG3 PKP1 and CLCA2) which are associated to desmosomes were found to be up-regulated in SCC compared to the AC subtype 26 . Concretely DSG3 showed high expression in SCC while low expression in AC 26 . DSC3 was also upregulated in SCC exclusively 27 28 . In primary lung tumors DSC3 was a potential diagnostic marker for lung squamous cell carcinoma 29 . PKP1 showed a times greater level of expression in SCCs than in ACs and normal lung and thus may be useful in histopathological diagnosis 28 . CLCA2 has been inferred to be specifically overexpressed in SCC 30 . We found that subtype AC (SCC) was present (absent) if and only if NKX2-1 was expressed. It is inferred that the expression of NKX2-1 in the specimen of AC is much higher than that of SCC. NKX2-1 which is known as thyroid transcription factor 1 (TITF-1) is a homeodomain-containing transactivating factor and it expressed in the terminal lung bronchioles and lung periphery predominantly 31 . The presence of NKX2-1 protein was prevalent in AC while in SCC NKX2-1 was absent 13 . It is in accordance with our results. Examples of gene-subtype higher logic relationships The higher logic relationships between gene pairs and SCC were selected for further analysis. Gene pairs (GPX2 ITGB8) and (GPX2 SLC2A12) were related with SCC via an AND logical relationship (higher logic relationship type ). It indicates that GPX2 ITGB8 and SLC2A12 were all expressed if the specimen was SCC. Moreover all of the genes GPX2 ITGB8 and SLC2A12 were not expressed if the specimen was AC. GPX2 was detected to have higher expression in SCC compared with AC and normal 32 33 . We were unaware of evidence in the literature of the relationships between ITGB8 SLC2A12 and the subtypes of NSCLC. Our analysis generated several novel relationships. There are not enough evidences for higher logic relationships to distinguish the subtypes of NSCLC. Hence most of the relationships between gene pairs and the subtypes of NSCLC have not been confirmed. As the lack of knowledge about the regulation relationships between genes and subtypes the exact relationships between the common gene pairs and subtypes are deserved to be checked. Performance comparison We exacted the columns of binary probe data as well as those of phenotype profile data which correspond to the NSCLC specimens and normal specimens of GSE18842. The new binary probe data and phenotype profile data were formed by the exacted columns of binary probe data and phenotype profile data maintaining the relative positions of columns. The NSCLC and normal data comprised the new binary probe data and phenotype profile data. Application of the three methods We firstly applied the current method to the NSCLC and normal data. We set the and obtained probe-phenotype lower logic relationships. The significance and global significance of the discovered relationships were verified by statistic test. Next we applied the NMF method to the NSCLC and normal data. Rows with s were filtered from the binary probe data to ensure the feasibility of the NMF method. The rest binary probe data contained rows and columns. Because two clusters of specimens (AC and SCC) were included in the binary probe data we chose as the dimensionality reduction parameter for the NMF method. Among the obtained two metagenes the second metagene had higher expression level in almost all (i.e. ) of the NSCLC specimens while lower expression level in almost all (i.e. ) of the normal specimens. The probes within the second metagene were sorted according to their activation levels (Table S4). The first probe represented the most closely related probe to the NSCLC phenotype while the last probe represented the least closely related probe. Finally we applied the RA method to the NSCLC and normal data. We sorted the probes by the mutual information between the probe profiles and NSCLC profiles. Note that the correlations between gene pairs and phenotypes could be measured by the current method but they could not be measured by the NMF and RA methods. Hence from this point of view the current method is superior to the two earlier methods. All of the three methods could find single genes closely related with phenotypes. Hence we just identified the gene-phenotype lower logic relationships by the current method and compared the results with those obtained by the two earlier methods. Performance comparison for the three methods We selected two datasets involved the genes which are related with NSCLC. One dataset contains high frequency genes on the mRNA level detected by Huang et al. (Table S5) 9 . It was showed that these genes belonged to the top dysfunctional gene sets with good discriminating ability. We chose the dataset because it was collected from GEO with the accession number GSE18842 which was also the source of the NSCLC and normal data in this work. The other dataset contains up- down-regulated genes found by Urgard et al. where genes are down-regulated and genes are up-regulated in NSCLC compared to the normal tissue (Table S5) 34 . A total of genes were shared by the above two datasets. Because it is hard to validate the genes included in each dataset it is reasonable to consider these genes as the truth data to estimate the performance of different methods in this work. In order to estimate the performance of the current method and compare its performance with the two earlier methods (the NMF method and the RA method) we calculated a measure: the recall rate which was the ratio of the number of detected genes in the truth data to the total number of genes in the truth data. Note that the recall rate may be biased by the incomplete nature of the truth data. Further we evaluated the classification accuracy which evaluated the discriminating ability of resulted probes. Among all of the genes detected by probes obtained by the current method genes were in the truth data. Hence the recall rate of the current method was . To compare the recall rate of the current method with those of the two earlier methods we selected the top probes obtained by the NMF method and the RA method respectively. We found and zero of the genes in the truth data have been detected by the NMF method and the RA method respectively. Hence the recall rate of NMF and RA were and respectively. The current method had higher recall rate than NMF and RA. By Fig. 1 we found that the current method achieved higher classification accuracy than the NMF method and the RA method. Additionally the average classification accuracy of our method approached to (i.e. ) which means that the probes obtained by our method has a great classification ability. In the figure each curve was steady with little fluctuation. It indicates that the classification accuracy was little sensitive to the number of probes. .0094644.g001 The recall rate of genes obtained by three methods. According to each method we rank the genes in descending order by the coefficients of genes related with phenotypes. We selecte the top genes where . The classification accuracy is calculated based on the top genes. RA NMF and U represent the relevance analysis method the non-negative matrix factorization method and the current method respectively. Biomarkers and key gene pairs Biomarkers inferred by gene-subtype lower logic relationships In previous research a total number of genes have been reported to be used to differentiate between AC and SCC and these genes are DSG3 26 CLCA2 30 DSC3 27 PKP1 28 NKX2-1 35 GJB5 26 KRT6B 36 SERPINB13 36 TP63 37 TRIM29 38 KRT5 28 NTRK2 28 and DST 39 . We sorted the genes which were involved in the gene-AC SCC lower logic relationships in descending order by their coefficients. Interestingly all of above genes were included in the top genes. It is suggested that a gene which has high uncertainty coefficient may clearly distinguish AC from SCC. To obtain a set of biomarkers we firstly selected the top ranked genes (Fig. 2). Because the molecular targets for targeted therapeutic agents play crucial roles for tumor the biomarkers for targeted therapy should have the distinct biological functions between NSCLC and normal. Next an intersection set was generated between top genes and the genes involved in gene-NSCLC lower logic relationships (the genes have been obtained in subsection Performance comparison ). Finally intersect genes were regarded as the biomarkers for distinguishing\nLabels: [Thyroid_Cancer, Colon_Cancer, Lung_Cancer]\nReply with one label only.", "assistant": "Lung_Cancer"}

{"system": "You are a medical text classifier. Choose exactly one label.", "user": "Text: observed depth in DNA-WGS and an alternate probability of the predicted DNA MAF. The number of true positives and false positives were tabulated at each model discrimination threshold i.e. P-value or score. The step function of these points (number of false positives versus number of true positives) generated a performance curve in absolute counts that is equivalent to a ROC curve without the denominators of total positives and negatives which were constant and unknown for the validation cohort. Between models performance curves were compared by area under the curve from 0 to 3000 false positives and by the number of true positives (proportional to sensitivity) at fixed numbers of false positives (proportional to 1 ? specificities) of 250 500 and 1000). P-values were calculated to provide evidence for the change in area under the curve and sensitivity estimates using permutation (see Simulation analysis methods). RESULTS Mutation detection models Existing methods to detect somatic mutations are based on either DNA sequencing alone or on RNA sequencing alone and do not integrate more than one type of sequencing (913 17). In order to test whether integrating DNA-WES and RNA-seq enables superior somatic mutation detection versus the current standard of DNA-WES alone a new method was developed called UNCeqR. UNCeqR contains different models for detecting somatic mutations based on different sequencing input and statistical modeling. Briefly UNCeqRMETA integrates tumor DNA-WES and RNA-seq UNCeqRDNA uses tumor DNA-WES and UNCeqRRNA uses tumor RNA-seq. UNCeqR software is available at http: lbg.med.unc.edu tools unceqr. Evaluation in simulated tumor sequencing To test our hypothesis that somatic mutation detection based on integrated RNA-seq and DNA-WES is superior to that based on DNA-WES alone simulated tumor genomes were generated so that the entire genome space is a completely defined truth of positive and negative somatic mutations. In brief for each patient's sequencing 500 mutant sites were sampled for each site a mutant allele was randomly sampled and then aligned reads in the real RNA-seq and DNA-WES were edited to have the mutant allele at a rate of a fixed MAF (Supplementary Figure S2). By using real sequencing as the basis of the simulation authentic sequencing depths random errors (sequencing and alignment) and patients germline variants were preserved. Sequencing from the lung cancer quadruplet cohort was used for simulation. Patients DNA-WES and RNA-seq had large and similar numbers of sequenced nucleotides (DNA-WES median: 10.6 billion RNA-seq median: 10.2 billion; Kruskal-Wallis P 0.54) indicating no significant imbalance in total sequencing. UNCeqR models were applied to the simulated tumor sequencing and detected mutations were compared against the truth by receiver operating characteristic curves. In simulations with a 10 MAF (A) the UNCeqRMETA model had significantly superior performance over UNCeqRDNA (difference in area under the curve P 0.01); in other words UNCeqRMETA achieved a greater true positive rate (greater sensitivity) at the same false positive rate (same specificity) than UNCeqRDNA. In simulations with a 20 MAF (B) UNCeqRMETA continued to be superior to UNCeqRDNA (difference in area under the curve P 0.01) although the gain in 20 MAF simulations was less (roughly 50 less) than the gain in 10 MAF simulations. This demonstrates that adding RNA-seq improved sensitivity particularly when the mutation signal that is MAF was low. UNCeqRMETA and UNCeqRDNA had large and clear superior performance to UNCeqRRNA which incurred false positives at a higher rate. Alternative ways to integrate RNA and DNA (taking the union or intersection of UNCeqRDNA and UNCeqRRNA) were both inferior to UNCeqRMETA (Supplementary Figure S3). Therefore in simulation UNCeqRMETA achieved superior performance over UNCeqRDNA with the largest gains occurring in mutations with low MAF. . Mutation detection performance in simulated tumor genomes. Model performance is displayed as receiver operating characteristic curves. Sensitivity plateaus below 1 because simulated mutations include sites with zero tumor sequencing depth in DNA and or RNA (see Simulation analysis methods). Validation by whole genome sequencing To validate the superior performance of integrated DNA-WES and RNA-seq mutation detection (UNCeqRMETA) over DNA-WES only detection (UNCeqRDNA) tumor and germline whole genome DNA sequencing (DNA-WGS) was used as an independent measure of truth for evaluating DNA-WES and RNA-seq mutation detections. Following a published validation procedure (4) mutation detections were interrogated in patient-matched DNA-WGS to determine if a mutation detection was a true positive that is present in the tumor specimen and absent from the germline specimen or false positive that is absent from the tumor specimen or present in the germline specimen. For each mutation model true positives and false positives were summed at each discrimination threshold (e.g. P-value) to generate a performance curve by which true positive rates could be compared at the same false positive rates (see methods for further description). These curves demonstrated that UNCeqRMETA achieved overall superior performance than UNCeqRDNA (difference in area under the curve P 0.01) and at fixed false positive thresholds (250 500 and 1000) thus validating the result from simulated tumor genomes (). Therefore in real tumor sequencing integrated DNA and RNA mutation detection by UNCeqRMETA outperformed DNA-only mutation detection. . Validation of mutation detection by whole genome sequencing. The number of true positives and false positives of mutation detection models are plotted as step functions. At fixed false positive totals (250 500 or 1000) each pair of models was compared for differences in number of true positives ( ). The published mutation set (46) did not include mutation rankings and was not amenable to rank-based statistical analysis. Other models displayed overall reduced performance relative to UNCeqRMETA and UNCeqRDNA. As another DNA-only control a leading (45) DNA-WES mutation caller from Illumina Strelka (17) was run on the same DNA-WES. Strelka exhibited inferior performance overall smaller true positive rates at fixed false positive rates and never achieved the sensitivity of UNCeqRMETA or UNCeqRDNA (). Strelka had greater sensitivity than UNCeqRMETA or UNCeqRDNA at the highest extreme of specificity; however at UNCeqR's minimum false positive rate Strelka's sensitivity was only ?70 of either UNCeqR model. Providing another DNA-only control previously published mutations of this cohort made by heterogeneous pipelines (46915 16) had reduced sensitivity than UNCeqRMETA and UNCeqRDNA at the same false positive rate (256 false positives). At this false positive rate indel mutation detections were rare in all models (maximum 1.7 ) with UNCeqRMETA and UNCeqRDNA having no significant difference in indel precision (number of true positives divided by the sum of false positives and true positives 92 and 96 respectively) but both having greater indel precision than Strelka (83 ) and previously published mutations (82 ) (proportions test P 0.001). Taking the union or intersection of UNCeqRDNA and UNCeqRRNA had higher false positive rates and inferior performance than UNCeqRMETA or UNCeqRDNA (Supplementary Figure S4A). Integrating Strelka with an RNA-seq mutation detector SNVmix did not result in superior performance versus Strelka UNCeqRDNA or UNCeqRMETA (Supplementary Figure S4A). Providing a separate source of validation UNCeqRMETA detected nearly all mutations that were published as validated by targeted resequencing within this cohort (up to 97 depending on the model threshold; Supplementary Figure S5). Repeating this analysis with a slightly increased true positivity definition minimum two confirming tumor WGS DNA reads maintained all findings listed above (Supplementary Figure S4B). Increased mutation signal in RNA-seq To analyze integrated mutation detection across larger cohorts UNCeqR was applied to the lung and breast triplet cohorts (n 871) and using model thresholds with the same empirically estimated specificity (500 false positives in DNA-WGS validation sequencing marked as triangle point in UNCeqRMETA P-value ? 1.1 Ã 10?9 UNCeqRDNA P-value ? 9.3 Ã 10?9). About half (49 ) of UNCeqRMETA mutations had no RNA evidence and were based only on DNA evidence. Surprisingly among UNCeqRMETA expressed somatic mutations (those with RNA and DNA mutant read evidence) the MAF in RNA was often significantly greater than in DNA (lung: 21 of expressed mutations breast: 17 fdr 0.05) (Figure 3A and Supplementary Figure S6A). This increase was often 2-fold (lung: 12 of expressed mutations breast: 11 ). In contrast DNA MAF was significantly greater than RNA MAF at much lower frequency (lung: 2 of expressed mutations breast: 3 fdr 0.05). As a control germline variants were detected in germline DNA-WES and patient-matched germline RNA-seq relative to the reference genome by UNCeqRMETA under the same settings as somatic mutation detection (Figure 3B and Supplementary Figure S6B). In contrast to expressed somatic mutations expressed germline variants displayed rare significant differences in allele fraction (RNA greater than DNA: lung: 0.8 breast: 0.7 ; DNA RNA: lung 0.1 breast: 0.3 ). Therefore the prevalent increased mutation signal in RNA-seq was cancer-specific. Figure 3. Mutation signal in RNA versus DNA.

Distributions of MAF difference among driver genes having a significant difference in MAF over all mutations (C). MAF distributions for all TP53 UNCeqRMETA mutations expressed and unexpressed (C and D). In addition to the genome-wide phenomenon the increased mutation signal in RNA versus DNA might additionally be frequent in cancer driver genes. Lung and breast cancer's driver genes (46) with at least 10 prevalence were analyzed for differences in RNA to DNA MAF across all mutations whether expressed or not. Eight driver genes had significantly different MAF between DNA and RNA (Wilcoxon signed rank test fdr 0.05; Figure 3C). All of these genes had greater median MAF in RNA than in DNA including an oncogene PIK3CA and tumor suppressors such as TP53. The TP53 MAF distributions of lung and breast cancer had remarkable similarities (Figure 3D) in that nonsynonymous and splice site mutations had extremely high RNA MAF relative to DNA MAF often 2-fold greater. Stop-gain and frameshift mutations in TP53 had greater MAF in DNA versus RNA but these decreases were less common and had a smaller magnitude in MAF difference. The TP53 results extend an earlier report in lung cancer using direct sequencing of TP53 RNA transcripts which found mutant transcript predominant expression (46). In summary expressed mutations tend to have larger mutation signal in RNA than in DNA. Importantly this effect was common among driver genes suggesting that integrating DNA and RNA for mutation detection provides the best opportunity to identify cancer causing mutations. Because DNA copy number can affect the quantity of tumor versus germline DNA at a locus tumor DNA copy number alterations were compared among mutations with a significantly greater MAF in RNA versus DNA and vice versa. Mutations with greater MAF in RNA exhibited a small (roughly 5 ) relative increase in DNA copy number deletions (Supplementary Figure S7) suggesting that RNA is beneficial to detect mutations in regions of genome deletion. MAF differences in TP53 mutations did not associate with either DNA amplifications or DNA deletions (Supplementary Figure S7). Large gains in low purity tumors Because low tumor purity (caused by normal contamination and multiple clones) can affect mutation detection (28) the outcome of integrating RNA-seq and DNA-WES in mutation detection was compared among tumors by their purity. The rate of mutation gain after adding RNA-seq to DNA-WES was non-uniform both in the breast and lung triplet cohorts such that the greatest gains occurred in tumors having the lowest purity. Specifically tumors total mutation ratio (the number of mutations detected by UNCeqRMETA over UNCeqRDNA) had significant negative correlation with tumor purity in both lung and breast cancer (Figure 4A). Mutation gains were largest among tumors with purity 40 . In addition tumors average difference in mutation signal between RNA and DNA (the mean difference of RNA MAF to DNA MAF across all expressed UNCeqRMETA mutations) also had significant negative correlation with tumor purity both in lung and breast cancer (Figure 4B). Therefore tumors with low purity had the largest RNA-seq mutation signal and gained the most new mutations after incorporation of RNA-seq evidence. Figure 4. Tumor purity effects on mutation detection. Lines summarize breast and lung triplet cohorts displaying total mutation ratios (A) or mean mutant allele fraction difference within expressed mutations (B) among tumors binned by tumor purity quintile and plotted at midpoint. Pearson's correlation tests compared the association of mutation ratio and MAF associations among triplet cohort tumors (P). MAF distributions from two exemplar low purity tumors mutations (C and D). Diagonal lines indicate equal MAF in DNA-WES and RNA-seq with mutations above the diagonal having greater MAF in RNA below the diagonal greater MAF in DNA. Unexpressed mutations are marked along the horizontal axes in (C and D). Examples of low purity tumors with large mutation gains include a low purity breast tumor that had 1.8 total mutation ratio and a mean 0.18 difference in mutation signal among expressed mutations. Two of this tumor's mutations with much larger signal in RNA than DNA occurred in PIK3CA (p.H1047R) and GATA3 (p.S412fs) (Figure 4C). These mutations occur in major mutational hotspots (47) and are also characteristic molecular drivers for the Luminal A expression subtype (648) of which this tumor is a member. Incorporation of RNA-seq evidence was essential to identify these two driving mutations; e.g. there was only 1 DNA read with the PIK3CA mutation but 29 mutant reads in RNA-seq (Figure 5). An example lung tumor had a 1.2 total mutation ratio and an average 0.22 difference in mutation signal among expressed mutations including CDKN2A (p.H98P) and TP53 (p.R273H) which exhibited very large RNA MAF (at 100 and 84 ) relative to DNA MAF (at 43 and 46 ) (Figure 4D). These PIK3CA GATA3 and TP53 mutations were not detected by earlier studies utilizing DNA-WES alone (46) emphasizing the advantage of RNA integration. In summary the addition of RNA-seq to DNA-WES substantially boosted mutation sensitivity for low purity tumors. Figure 5. Example of somatic mutation only detectable by RNA and DNA integration. Mutation detected by UNCeqRMETAP 1e-16. Read alignment display from integrative genomics viewer (43) for a low purity breast tumor at the major mutational hotspot of PIK3CA (47). Increased mutation rates of driver and therapeutically-targeted genes To determine if UNCeqRMETA made new mutation discoveries in patients tumor genomes UNCeqRMETA mutations were compared to previously published patient mutation profiles on the triplet cohorts (46). Specifically tumors non-silent mutations (those that change protein sequence and can contribute to cancer development) of UNCeqRMETA that were novel compared to published profiles were tabulated within genes known to be relevant in cancer development (187 genes from the Cancer Gene Census (49) and published driver genes (46)). Five hundred and sixty-seven novel mutations were detected covering 67 of these cancer-relevant genes. 69 of these novel mutations had DNA-WES and RNA-seq evidence indicating that the addition of RNA contributed to the vast majority of these novel mutations. Grouped by patients 44 of patients tumors had an increase of at least one new mutation in this cancer-relevant gene set and among patient tumors with zero published mutations in this gene set 42 had at least one new mutation discovered by UNCeqRMETA. Grouped by gene many of these novel mutations comprised large gains in absolute counts and in percent increase (Figure 6A and B) including MAP3K1 and GATA3 in breast cancer and NOTCH2 and CDKN2A in lung cancer. These gains spanned all nucleotide mutation types (substitution insertion and deletion) and protein coding impacts; for instance novel GATA3 mutations had abundant novel frameshift insertion frameshift deletion non-synonymous and nonsense mutations (Supplementary Figure S8). Notably mutation rates for genes targeted by drugs were increased by UNCeqRMETA specifically PIK3CA FGFR2 and ERBB2. Therefore UNCeqRMETA largely advanced published state-of-the-art mutation profiles with cancer-relevant mutations by utilizing the integration of RNA-seq and DNA-WES. Figure 6. Novel mutation discoveries in cancer-relevant genes. Increases in mutation absolute count versus relative increase are displayed for selected genes (A and B). Percentage increase is the number of novel UNCeqRMETA mutations over the number of published mutations (46)for a gene. Absolute counts for select genes among breast (C) and lung (D) cancer expression subtypes. Breast cancer subtypes (48) were previously found to have distinct rates of mutations across four genes (TP53 GATA3 MAP3K1 and PIK3CA) and in combination with other evidence such as pathway alterations are understood to be driven by their distinct somatic alterations (6). Across these four genes novel mutations detected by UNCeqRMETA occurred most frequently in tumors of the same expression subtype as had been previously reported. Specifically the greatest number of novel mutations occurred in the following subtypes: TP53 in Basal MAP3K1 in Luminal A PIK3CA in Luminal A and GATA3 in Luminal A and Luminal B (Figure 6C). In lung cancer there were appreciable increases in NOTCH1 and NOTCH2. The largest numbers of novel UNCeqRMETA NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 mutations occurred in different lung cancer expression subtypes (50) of Classical and Basal respectively (Figure 6D). Combining novel UNCeqR non-silent mutations with those previously reported both of these genes now had significant association with expression subtype (NOTCH1 Fisher's test P 0.02; NOTCH2 Fisher's test P 0.03). Therefore the advance of UNCeqRMETA over published mutation profiles included new subtype-specific driving mutations new putative subtype-specific driver genes and new patients with mutations in driver genes. DISCUSSION Herein we sought to determine if adding patient-matched RNA-seq to DNA-WES would improve somatic mutation detection. To this end we developed UNCeqR a first-of-its-kind method that integrates RNA-seq and DNA-WES to detect somatic mutations. By simulation and validation in whole genome sequencing the UNCeqRMETA model that integrates DNA and RNA had significantly superior performance to models based on DNA alone (UNCeqRDNA Strelka and published mutation profiles). Then we applied UNCeqR to large breast and lung cohorts (n 871) and analyzed their integrated RNA and DNA mutations resulting in several novel characterizations of tumor genomics. We report for the first time a remarkable finding that low purity tumors experience the largest gains in total mutations and in mutation signal (MAF) when adding RNA-seq to DNA-WES. Also we originally report that that MAF tends to be elevated in RNA versus DNA among expressed genes and that this phenomenon is cancer-specific. Based on these observations we conclude that rare cancerous cells within a tumor may exhibit over-expression relative to the tumor's normal cells which increases the concentration of cancer cell's mutations in a locus expressed transcripts thus boosting the RNA mutation signal. In contrast low purity tumors DNA mutation signal even if copy number altered may be drowned out by the normal cell DNA and cannot achieve the magnitude of the RNA mutation signal. High purity tumors smaller increases in RNA mutant allele signal versus DNA could be caused by mutant allele-specific expression or the presence of minor cancer clones within the tumor. In summary RNA-seq when added to DNA-WES is particularly useful for mutation detection in low purity tumors. For mutations with therapeutic significance highly sensitive and specific assays are essential for informing patient therapy and for clinical trials investigating new agents. Relative to published mutations derived from DNA-WES alone the UNCeqRMETA mutations derived from patient-matched DNA-WES and RNA-seq increased the numbers of patients with mutations in genes that are targets for several drugs in clinical trials such as PIK3CA and ERBB2 and for drugs with correlative evidence such as FGFR2 (51). Clinical trials such as NCT01670877 which involve ERBB2 sequencing (52) may be influenced to include RNA-seq due the large mutation rate increase reported here. Although the relative increase in PIK3CA mutations was modest compared to other genes in breast cancer this improved sensitivity is vital for affected patients and could lead to positive clinical trial outcomes. For example some novel canonical mutations in PIK3CA had many mutant\nLabels: [Thyroid_Cancer, Colon_Cancer, Lung_Cancer]\nReply with one label only.", "assistant": "Lung_Cancer"}

Choose exactly one label.", "user": "Text: Purpose The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate whether 18F FDG-PET CT performed within two weeks of starting erlotinib therapy can predict tumor response defined by RECIST 1.1 criteria after 8 weeks of treatment in patients with inoperable (stage IIIA to IV) non-small cell lung cancer patients. Patients and Methods Three 18F FDG-PET CT scans were acquired in 12 patients before (5 4 days) and after 9 3 days (early PET) and 60 6 days (late PET) of erlotinib therapy. Conventional evaluation including at least chest CT (baseline versus after 8 weeks of treatment) was performed according to RECIST 1.1 criteria. Change in 18F FDG uptake was compared with conventional response progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Results By using ROC analysis the Area Under the Curve for prediction of metabolic non-progressive disease (mNP) by early PET was 0.86 (95 CI 0.62 to 1.1; P? ?0.04) at a cut-off of 21.6 reduction in maximum Standardized Uptake Value (SUVmax). This correctly classified 11 12 patients (7 with true progressive disease; 4 with true non-progressive disease; 1 with false progressive disease). Non-progressive disease after 8 weeks of treatment according to RECIST 1.1 criteria was significantly more frequent in patients classified mNP (P? ?0.01 Fisher's exact test). mNP patients showed prolonged PFS (HR? ?0.27; 95 CI 0.04 to 0.59; P 0.01) and OS (HR? ?0.34; 95 CI 0.06 to 0.84; P? ?0.03). Late PET analysis provided concordant results. Conclusion Morphologic response PFS and OS survival in non-small cell lung cancer patients can be predicted by 18F FDG-PET CT scan within 2 weeks after starting erlotinib therapy. The authors have no support or funding to report. Introduction Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in both Europe 1 and the United States of America. 2 The most common forms of lung cancer are non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) histological subtypes. Systemic chemotherapy has contributed to a significant improvement in NSCLC therapy but progress appears to be stagnating. 3 4 Over the last decade a better knowledge of cellular pathways has allowed the development of new therapies based on NSCLC-driving genetic abnormalities. Targeted therapies have been developed to block pathological cellular pathways involved in cancer cell survival proliferation and metastasis. Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) is overexpressed in NSCLC 5 and has been extensively studied as a potential therapeutic target. Two EGF Receptor blockers gefitinib and erlotinib have been demonstrated to be effective in front-line therapy in patients with inoperable NSCLC harboring EGFR-activating mutations. 6 7 Erlotinib is also authorized after failure of previous chemotherapy and as maintenance therapy. 8 9 In clinical practice evaluation of tumor response is based on changes in tumor size according to criteria proposed by the World Health anization 10 or RECIST criteria. 11 12 This morphological evaluation may lead to underestimation of the efficacy of cytostatic therapeutic agents such as erlotinib that stabilize the disease in non-mutated patients whereas conventional cytotoxic drugs induce shrinkage of tumor dimensions in the case of tumor response. NSCLC tumor size evaluation can also be difficult due to atelectasis of normal lung. The major limitations to morphological imaging methods are their inability to assess response to therapy at an early stage and their inability to identify cancer in residual masses after treatment. In patients with NSCLC 18F FDG-PET has been recognized as an adequate staging tool 13 14 and several studies also suggest that the standardized uptake value (SUV) has a prognostic value in NSCLC. 15 16 The value of SUV for evaluation of tumor response to targeted therapy is currently being investigated. We designed a preliminary study to evaluate tumor response in NSCLC patients eligible for erlotinib therapy. The aim of this prospective study was to determine whether 18F FDG-PET CT performed several days after starting erlotinib therapy could predict tumor response defined by RECIST 1.1 criteria and 18F FDG-PET CT after 8 weeks of treatment. Materials and Methods Patients Twelve consecutive eligible patients with stage IIIA to IV NSCLC (7 adenocarcinomas 3 large cell carcinomas 2 squamous cell carcinomas) in whom erlotinib therapy was indicated were studied at the Angers University Hospital France. Screening for EGF receptor mutations was carried out (patient characteristics are shown in ). Eligibility criteria were: histologically or cytologically proven NSCLC; unresectable stage III IV disease or recurrent disease after surgery; age over 18 years; measurable disease according to RECIST 1.1 criteria; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status between 0 to 2; adequate bone marrow function liver function and renal function. Patients were not included if they had previous lung diseases such as interstitial pneumonitis or lung fibrosis identified by chest Computed Tomography (CT) scan or diabetes mellitus that could artefact PET imaging. Life expectancy was predicted to be longer than 12 weeks. Erlotinib was administered orally in a dosage of 150 mg day on an empty stomach until clinical disease progression unacceptable toxicity or patient refusal.

PET CT examinations were obtained in 2D mode from the vertex to mid-thighs (5 minutes of emission scan per bed position with an average of 7 bed positions at 15 cm intervals) (Discovery-ST GE Healthcare France). Patients were instructed to fast for at least 6 hours prior to scanning. Unenhanced CT scan was performed from the skull base to the upper thighs. CT parameters were 120 kVp 100 mAs 0.8 second rotation 3.27 mm slice collimation and Pitch 1.5. CT data were used for attenuation correction and PET images were reconstructed by clinical standard 2D-iterative algorithm (ordered subset expectation maximization using 4 iterations and 16 subsets; zoom 100 ; image matrix size: 128 128; and Gaussian post-smoothing of 5 mm in full width at half maximum). No corrections for partial volume effect lean body mass or blood glucose levels were applied. Conventional evaluation Conventional staging and follow-up were performed according to standards of care. 11 12 Conventional evaluation included at least clinical examination plus CT scan performed before (CT1; 7 6 days) and 8 weeks after (CT2; 58 8 days) starting erlotinib therapy. None of the patients underwent additional CT scanning during the 2 weeks after starting erlotinib therapy. Chest abdomen and pelvis CT scans (Brillance 64 PHILIPS Medical System France) were acquired from the lung apex to the symphysis pubis after an intravenous embolus of 130 mL of iodinated contrast agent (Xenetix350 ). Helical scanning parameters were 130 kVp 120 mAs 1 second rotation 4 mm slice collimation 8 mm s bed speed and 3 mm section width. Image analysis and response evaluation CT data were interpreted by two experienced physicians specialists in thoracic oncology blinded to PET CT results according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1 criteria 12 ) by comparison of baseline CT scan (CT1) and final CT scan (CT2). Therapeutic response evaluation was defined as: 1) complete response (CR: disappearance of all target lesions); 2) partial response (PR: at least 30 decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of five target lesions); 3) progressive disease (PD: at least a 20 increase in the sum of the longest diameter of five target lesions); and 4) stable disease (SD: neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD). Patients were then classified in the progressive disease (P) group or the non-progressive disease (NP) group including CR PR and SD therapeutic response. 18F FDG PET interpretation was performed on an Imagys workstation (Keosys Saint-Herblain France) qualitatively and semi-quantitatively by two experienced nuclear medicine physicians blinded to clinical and conventional evaluation results. Any focus of increased 18F FDG uptake over background not located in areas of normal 18F FDG uptake and or 18F FDG excretion was considered to be positive for tumor. For semi-quantitative analyses of 18F FDG uptake 3D regions of interest (VOIs) were placed over all lesions considered to be positive for tumor by using Imagys software (Keosys France). The maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) was calculated using the single hottest pixel inside the tumor VOI. SUV peak was also calculated using a 1.2 cm diameter spherical VOI containing the SUVmax. Bone lesions were not taken into account as they were considered to be non-measurable lesions. For patients with more than one tumor lesion the sum of SUVmax and SUVpeak were calculated and used for evaluation of changes between PET1 and PET2. PET measurements were performed in up to a maximum of five measurable target lesions. All SUVs were normalized to the injected dose and patient body weight. The percentage changes in SUV between PET1 and PET2 were finally calculated as follows: ?SUV? ?(SUV1?SUV2) SUV1. The same protocol was used for PET1 and PET3. Statistical analysis Data are expressed as mean SD excepted for survival data that were expressed as the median. The primary endpoint of the study was comparison of changes in tumor 18F FDG uptake on PET2 versus PET1 PET3 versus PET1 and subsequent CT scan evaluation at 8 weeks after initiation of erlotinib therapy. Friedman test was used for non-parametric comparison of repeated measures. The secondary endpoints were to determine the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis for 18F FDG changes with regard to predicting response to erlotinib therapy. The relationship between metabolic response (patients stratified according to the median value of SUV variations) and clinical response was analyzed by Fisher's exact test. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were determined by standard Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and between-group comparison was performed by log-rank test. PFS was defined as the time interval from the date of enrolment in the study until the first signs of progression. OS was calculated from the date of enrolment until death from any cause. All analyses were performed using Graphpad prism version 4.0 b 2004 (Graphpad Software San Diego CA). The limit of significance was set at 0.05. Results Population Twelve eligible patients with NSCLC 6 women (50 ) and 6 men (50 ) with a mean age of 60 13 years were included. Two patients presented tumors harboring an activating Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor mutation (2573T G substitution (p.Leu858Arg) in exon 21 in one patient; deletion (L747_E749del) in exon 19 in the other patient). Patient characteristics are described in . The median duration of erlotinib therapy was 75 days. Due to rapid progression and death PET3 and CT3 could not be performed in 2 patients. Tumor 18F-FDG uptake The three 18F FDG PET CT scans were acquired as follows: PET1 5 4 days before starting therapy PET2 9 3 days after starting therapy and PET3 60 6 days after starting erlotinib therapy. Scanning started 68 17 min (PET1) 71 16 min (PET2) and 64 13 min (PET3) after 18F FDG injection of 271 53 MBq (PET1) 270 61 MBq (PET2) and 263 54 MBq (PET3). Blood glucose level was less than 1.5 g L for all PET examinations i.e. 1.1 0.1 g L for PET1 1.1 0.2 g L for PET 2 and 1.1 0.2 g L for PET3. Non-parametric Friedman tests did not show any significant difference between PET1 PET2 and PET3 for FDG uptake time injected FDG dose or blood glucose. Fifty-five lesions were described on PET1 before treatment and 45 lesions were defined as target lesions for PET evaluation of response to treatment (up to five most hypermetabolic lesions per patient; mean 3.8 lesions patient). The mean tumor SUVmax of the most 18F FDG avid lesion (SUVmax) was 10.0 4.7 for PET1 and did not vary significantly over time with a mean of 10.1 6.6 for PET2 and a mean of 9.1 5.6 for PET3 (P? ?0.97). The SUVpeak was 8.6 4.3 for PET1 8.1 5.4 for PET2 and 7.1 4.6 for PET3 and did not vary over time (P? ?0.60). No variation over time was observed for the sums of SUV. The mean sum of tumor SUVmax of all target lesions was 30.1 19.5 for PET1 27.5 17.7 for PET2 and 28.3 22.4 for PET3 (P? ?0.83). Sums of SUVpeak of all target lesions were 22.7 14.3 for PET1 20.6 13.4 for PET2 and 22.2 18.6 for PET3 (P? ?0.44). 18F FDG-PET response versus conventional evaluation CT scan data were interpreted by chest physicians blinded to PET CT scan results (Table 2). Evaluation of response to treatment according to RECIST 1.1 criteria demonstrated 7 patients with progressive disease (group P) and 5 patients with non-progressive disease (group NP) including 4 cases of stable disease (SD) and 1 partial response (PR). .0087629.t002 Table 2 CT and PET assessments of response rates OS and PFS.

Missing data are indicated as MD. On ROC analysis the AUC for prediction of non-progressive disease by PET2 was 0.86 (95 CI 0.62 to 1.1; P? ?0.04) corresponding to a maximum specificity of 0.80 and sensitivity of 0.86 for non-progressive disease at a cut-off of 21.6 reduction in SUVmax (Figure 1) and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 0.86 a negative predictive value (NPV) of 0.80 an accuracy of 0.83 and a maximum Youden index of 0.65. The use of this SUVmax cut-off value correctly classified 11 12 patients (7 with true progressive disease (Figures 2 and 3); 4 with true non-progressive disease (Figures 4 and 5); 1 with false progressive disease (Figure 6). Non-progression after 2 months of treatment was significantly more frequent in patients with an early decrease in SUVmax of 21.6 or more (P? ?0.01 Fisher's exact test). The only misclassified patient (patient 9 false progressive disease on PET2 versus PET1) displayed a 16.4 increase of SUVmax but metabolic progression was not confirmed on PET3 with a 5.4 decrease of SUVmax compared to PET1. Similar results were observed for SUVpeak as non-progressive disease after 2 months of treatment was significantly more frequent in patients with a decrease in SUVpeak of at least 17.6 on PET2 (P? ?0.01 Fisher's exact test). Similar results were also obtained in terms of AUC sensitivity specificity PPV NPV and accuracy and with the same classification of patients (7 with true progressive disease; 4 with true non-progressive disease; 1 with false progressive disease). .0087629.g001 Figure 1 Percentage change in SUVmax on 18F-FDG PET CT (cut-off: ?21.6 ) within 2 weeks of starting erlotinib therapy in relation to conventional imaging response.

It consists of a 7-item anxiety (HADS-A) and 7-item depression (HADS-D) subscale. The HADS shows good psychometric properties in the general medical population including oncology patients 42 . Internal consistency as measured with Cronbach s ? varied from .84 to .90 4042 .Test-retest reliability was good as Pearson s r .80 were obtained 4043 . Though the cut-off scores of the HADS vary among populations 44 in lung cancer patients they have found to be 8 versus ?8 on the HADS-A or HADS-D 45 . The HADS has been shown to be highly correlated with the Beck Depression Inventory 42 . It has previously been used in intervention studies of mindfulness and shown to be sensitive to change (e.g. 46 ). Secondary outcome measures Quality of life (only for patients) The European anisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Core Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) 47 is included along with the supplemental Lung Cancer questionnaire module (QLQ-LC13) 48 . The QLQ-C30 is designed to use in clinical trials on physical treatments for cancer patients. It incorporates five functional scales (physical role cognitive emotional social) three symptom scales (fatigue pain nausea and vomiting) a global health and quality of life scale and an array of single-item symptom measures. After revisions in the role functioning global health and physical functioning scale internal consistency of the subscales varied between .65 and .94 except for the cognitive functioning scale with ? varying from .56 to .63 474950 . Test-retest reliability varied from .63 to .86 51 . The lung cancer questionnaire module is designed to supplement the core questionnaire and comprises specific symptoms associated with lung cancer (coughing haemoptysis dyspnoea pain) and side-effects from conventional chemo- and radiotherapy (hair loss neuropathy sore mouth dysphagia). While the multi-item dyspnoea scale showed high internal consistency the pain subscale did not. When combined with the dyspnoea and pain items of the core questionnaire both the dyspnoea (? .86) and pain (? .71) subscale showed high internal consistency. Since the QLQ-C30 and QLQ-LC13 are mainly focused on physical symptoms we added the items Social Interaction and Alertness Behavior of the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP) 52 . Internal consistency was .94 and test-retest reliability was .92. The SIP correlated with self-assessed sickness and dysfunction 52 . Caregiver appraisal (only for partners) We use the 9-item Self-Perceived Pressure from Informal Care (SPPIC) 53 to assess the extent to which caregiving is experienced as burdensome. To also measure positive aspects of caregiving the 9-item subscale Care-Derived Self-Esteem of the Caregiver Reaction Assessment (CRA-SE) 54 is included. Internal consistency of the SPPIC was .79 and of the CRA-SE was .73. The SPPIC and CRA-SE were unrelated to each other 55 . Relationship quality To measure relationship satisfaction we included the 10-item Satisfaction subscale of the Investment Model Scale (IMS-S) 56 . The IMS-S starts with 5 items that measure concrete examplars of satisfaction to enhance the comprehensibility of the global items which are utilized to form the construct. Internal consistency varied from .79 to .95 and the IMS-S was related to the Dyadic Adjustment Scale. Also the Mutual Interpersonal Sensitivity scale (MIS) 57 is included to measure communication between partners about the cancer. It contains 18 items and is divided into two scales: open communication and avoiding negative thoughts about the cancer. Spirituality is measured with the Spiritual Attitude and Involvement List (SAIL) 58 and consists of 26 items divided into the subscales meaningfulness trust acceptance caring for others connectedness with nature transcendent experiences and spiritual activities. The internal consistency varied from .74 to .88 and test-retest reliability varied from .77 to .92. All subscales except for connectedness with nature were related with the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Spiritual Well-Being Scale. Costs (only for patients) The cost-effectiveness evaluation is carried out from a societal perspective considering direct as well as indirect health costs. Data on costs are collected prospectively using a diary in which participants register a) health care utilization: the type of care and its duration and b) cancer-related absence from work. Unit cost estimates are derived from the national manual for cost prices in the health care sector 59 . Costs of reduced ability to work are estimated using the friction costs method which results in a more realistic estimate than the human capital approach 60 . Treatment costs of MBSR are calculated using activity-based-costing methods thus measuring actual resources (time of therapist time of patients facilities) used. All unit cost prices are adjusted to 2013 prices. Unit cost estimates are combined with resource utilization data to obtain a net cost per patient over the entire follow-up period. Process measures Mindfulness skills are examined with the 39-item Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) 6162 . The FFMQ is based on an exploratory factor analysis of five mindfulness measures which allowed items from different instruments to form factors providing an empirical integration of these independent attempts to operationalize mindfulness. This led to the following five subscales: observing describing acting with awareness non-judging of inner experience and non-reactivity to inner experience. Internal consistency varied from .72 to .93 among the different subscales. Most subscales were related to meditation experience Psychological Well-Being scales and psychological symptoms including the Brief Symptom Inventory 61 . FFMQ is sensitive to change in mindfulness-based interventions and is found to mediate the relationship between mindfulness practice and improvements in psychological symptoms (e.g. 63 ). Self-compassion is assessed with the Self Compassion Scale (SCS) 6465 which has 26 items and is divided into six subscales: self-kindness versus self-judgment common humanity versus isolation and mindfulness versus over-identification. Internal consistency of the different subscales varied from .75 to .81 and test-retest reliability varied from .80 to .93. SCS correlated moderately with self-esteem measures including the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. Furthermore whereas the self-esteem measures correlated significantly with the Narcissistic Personality Inventory the SCS was unrelated to narcissism 64 . SCS is sensitive to change through mindfulness-based interventions and is found to mediate MBCT s treatment effects 66 . To measure rumination we administered the extended version of the Ruminative Response Scale (RRS-EXT) 67 Raes and Hermans: The revised version of the Dutch Ruminative Response Scale unpublished instrument . The RRS-EXT contains 26 items in which a more adaptive thinking style (i.e. reflection) is distinguished from a more maladaptive one (i.e. brooding). Internal consistency varied from .72 to .77 and test-retest reliability varied from .60 to .62 for the brooding and reflection subscales. The concept of rumination seems to be sensitive to change through mindfulness-based interventions and has been shown to mediate the effect of MBSR on depressive symptoms in oncology patients 68 . The psychological stress reaction is measured with the 15-item Impact of Event Scale (IES) 6970 which assesses two categories of responses: intrusive experiences and avoidance of thoughts and images associated with the event. Internal consistency varied from .65 to .92 71 and test-retest reliability varied from .79 to .87 among the subscales 69 . IES correlated with anxiety and depression subscales of the General Health Questionaire. Adherence to MBSR is assessed during the entire study period with a calendar on which participants in the MBSR condition fill out on a daily basis whether they adhere to the mindfulness exercises: either formal practice (e.g. meditation exercise like the bodyscan) informal practice (e.g. activity with awareness) or no exercise. Adherence to MBSR has been shown to mediate the effects of MBCT on depressive symptoms 72 . Statistical analysis plan Sample size To determine the required sample size first the sample size was calculated that would be needed for a simple t-test and subsequently it was corrected for clustering repeated measurements and baseline. A two-sided t-test on the total HADS score 3940 (i.e. our primary outcome measure examining psychological distress (HADS-total) anxiety symptoms (HADS-A) and depressive symptoms (HADS-D)) would require 64 participants in each group to have 80 power to detect a medium-sized difference (effect size 0.5) with alpha 0.05. To correct for clustering we multiplied this sample size of 64 with the design factor (1 (n ? 1) ICC) where n denotes the cluster size and where ICC denotes the intra-cluster correlation. In our study the treatment groups will consist of 14 people of whom about 7 will be patients. With n 7 and an estimated ICC 0.01. 72 the correction factor equals 1.06. To correct for repeated measurements and the use of the baseline measurement as a covariate we multiplied the required sample size by the design factor 1 ? 2??02 where ? denotes the correlation between the post-treatment HADS measurements and ?0 denotes the correlation between the baseline HADS with the post-treatment HADS measurements. With ? 0.8 and ? 0.5 as conservative estimates the second design factor equals 0.65. Consequently after correction for clustering and covariates we arrived at a required sample size of 0.65 1.06 64 44 patients per arm. So 88 patients with lung cancer would be required for the study. Based on our pilot study van den Hurk Schellekens Molema Speckens and van der Drift in preparation we expect a 20 drop-out rate. Therefore we intend to include 110 patients and 110 partners. Primary analyses The samples of lung cancer patients and partners will be analyzed separately. Baseline characteristics of the population will be compared between MBSR and control group to ensure that key variables were evenly distributed by randomization. First analyses will be based on the intention-to-treat approach. Next we will perform per-protocol analyses with the treatment-adherent sample (i.e. in the MBSR condition participants have to attend at least four of the eight MBSR sessions 73 and in the TAU condition participants do not attend a mindfulness-based programme). We will use linear mixed models to analyze all outcome variables (i.e. psychological distress quality of life (only for patient) caregiver appraisal (only for partner) relationship quality and spirituality) with treatment as fixed factor baseline measurement as covariate and a random intercept based on MBSR group. This procedure will use all observed data in our analyses. In addition Cohen s d effect size 74 will be reported based on the difference between the group means on baseline and follow-up scores divided by the pooled standard deviation at baseline and follow-up. Secondary analyses Cost effectiveness The quality of life measures (i.e. QLQ-C30; QLQ-LC13) will be used to calculate Quality of Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) for each individual. Costs and effects (in terms of QALYs) will be combined in the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). The ICER expresses cost-effectiveness in terms of incremental costs per QALY gained. To estimate confidence intervals for the mean of the ICER a non-parametric bootstrapping method will be used performing 1000 replications of the original data. In order to express the implications of the cost-effectiveness results more clearly a cost-acceptability curve will be constructed. In case of dominance a full cost analysis will be conducted to estimate the mean savings per patient per year. Mediation analyses To examine the possible underlying mechanisms of change in MBSR mediation analyses will be conducted. Only the data of the treatment-adherent sample will be included in these analyses. By means of a multiple mediation model suggested by Preacher and Hayes 75 we will test the mediating effect of mindfulness skills self-compassion rumination and adherence to MBSR on psychological distress quality of life (only in patients) caregiver appraisal (only in partners) relationship quality and spirituality. Discussion In the last ten years MBSR has not only proven to be a feasible and acceptable intervention in cancer patients 76 but it also seems to be effective in reducing psychological distress 30 . However the generalization of these results is limited because most participants were female patients with breast cancer. A large part of lung cancer patients already have advanced cancer at time of diagnosis and are confronted with a poor prognosis and low health status. Consequently they more often report psychological distress than patients with other diagnoses of cancer 89 . Hence it is not yet clear whether MBSR is a feasible acceptable and effective intervention in patients with lung cancer. Moreover little is known about the effectiveness of MBSR in partners of cancer patients 30 though they also often report psychological distress. Our pilot study of 19 lung cancer patients and 16 partners participating in an MBSR course provides preliminary evidence that MBSR is feasible and acceptable in this population (van den Hurk Schellekens Molema Speckens and van der Drift in preparation). The current trial will answer the question whether MBSR is effective in patients with lung cancer and their partners. We started enrolment of participants in February 2012. At the moment we think recruiting a sufficient number of patients and partners will be a challenge due to rapidly fluctuating health status and sudden changes in cancer treatment 77 . The main reasons for declining participation in patients is being too ill or that it is too much of a burden during chemo and or radiotherapy . Furthermore no perceived need or motivation for the training is commonly mentioned. Among partners participation is highly depending on whether the patient is willing to participate. Although partners can take part separately partners who are interested do often not participate when the patients decline participation. Considering the difficulty of studying lung cancer patients and their partners 77 our trial will offer valuable information on whether MBSR as one of the few available psychosocial care programmes contributes to the alleviation of their psychological distress.

On the basis of our experience and previous reports clinicians should exclude PLC when patients develop hypoxemia and interstitial pneumonia of unknown cause. PLC may cause significant deterioration of the patient s condition. Thus only early identification diagnosis and treatment can prolong the survival of liver carcinoma patients with PLC. Conclusions Although PLC is rare in liver carcinoma patients cancer cells can migrate into the pulmonary lymphatic system. Early identification diagnosis and treatment are crucial to improving the survival of PLC patients. Combined use of CT PET-CT and pathologic examinations may significantly increase the PLC detection rate. In our patient immunosuppressive therapy after liver transplantation caused rapid progression of PLC. Although we discontinued immunosuppressive therapy employed strategies to improve the patient s lung edema and administered antitumor therapy the efficacy of the treatment was still very poor.

Chemotherapy was continued for at least three cycles. Gefitinib was administered until the disease progressed intolerable toxicities developed or consent was withdrawn. The protocol recommended that the crossover regimen be used as a second-line treatment. Clinical Assessments The antitumor response to treatment was assessed using computed tomography every 2 months. Unidirectional measurements were adopted on the basis of the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (version 1.0).23 PFS was evaluated from the date of randomization to the date when disease progression was first observed or death occurred. The treatment response and PFS were determined by an external review of computed tomography scans by experts who were not aware of the treatment assignments. Overall survival (OS) was evaluated from the date of randomization to the date of death. Statistical Analysis To assess prognostic factors for OS we used univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models. Kaplan Meier survival curves were constructed for PFS and OS and differences between groups were identified using the log-rank test. Differences in response rates were identified using Fisher s exact test. Each analysis was two sided with a 5 significance level and a 95 confidence interval. All analyses were performed using SAS for Windows software (release 9.1; SAS Institute Cary NC). RESULTS Patient Population A total of 230 chemonaive patients were enrolled in the NEJ002 study: 115 patients were assigned to receive gefitinib and 115 were assigned to receive carboplatin-paclitaxel (Fig. 1). To evaluate the efficacy of gefitinib in NSCLC patients with uncommon EGFR mutations we analyzed the data of 114 patients in the gefitinib group and 111 patients in the carboplatin-paclitaxel group. We identified five patients who had uncommon EGFR mutations in each group. Two patients who had common mutations and were treated with first-line chemotherapy consisting of carboplatin-paclitaxel were excluded from the PFS analysis in the NEJ002 study. However both were treated with gefitinib and were included in this post-hoc analysis. The demographic and disease characteristics of the patients with uncommon EGFR mutations were similar to those of patients with common EGFR mutations (). The characteristics of each patient with uncommon EGFR mutations are shown in supplementary Table S1 (Supplemental Digital Content 1 http: links.lww.com JTO A494). FIGURE 1. Enrollment randomization and follow-up of the study patients. TABLE 1. Patient Characteristics Survival Factors In the univariate analysis of 225 patients who received gefitinib at any point uncommon EGFR mutations had a significant detrimental effect on survival (). We also identified performance statuses 1 and 2 distant metastasis brain metastasis stable disease and progressive disease as significant predictors of worse prognosis for standard chemotherapy and stable disease and progressive disease as significant predictors of worse prognosis for gefitinib. When these variables were included in the Cox proportional hazards model we found that uncommon EGFR mutations performance statuses 1 and 2 stable disease and progressive disease for standard chemotherapy and stable disease and progressive disease for gefitinib had significant hazard ratios (). TABLE 2. Univariate and Multivariate Analysis by Cox Proportional Hazards Model Uncommon EGFR Mutations and Survival The Kaplan Meier curve for OS for uncommon versus common EGFR mutations is shown in A. The OS was significantly shorter among patients with uncommon EGFR mutations compared with OS of those with common EGFR mutations in the overall population (12 versus 28.4 months; p 0.002). A significantly shorter survival time was observed in patients with uncommon EGFR mutations compared with survival time in those with common EGFR mutations in the gefitinib group (11.9 versus 29.3 months; p 0.001) (Fig. 2B). However a similar survival time was observed between the subgroups of uncommon and common EGFR mutations in the carboplatin-paclitaxel group (22.8 versus 28 months; p 0.358) (Fig. 2C). FIGURE 2. The overall survival curves of patients with common mutations and uncommon mutations in the entire population (A) the gefitinib group (B) and the carboplatin-paclitaxel group (C). To examine whether the sequence of platinum doublet and gefitinib affected OS we performed a further subgroup analysis. The survival time tended to be shorter among patients receiving first-line gefitinib compared with the survival time among those receiving first-line carboplatin-paclitaxel in the uncommon EGFR mutation group (11.9 versus 22.8 months; p 0.102). Consistent with previous publications a similar survival time was observed between patients receiving first-line gefitinib and those receiving first-line carboplatin-paclitaxel in the common EGFR mutation group (29.3 versus 28 months; p 0.378). Uncommon EGFR Mutations PFS and Response In the gefitinib group the median PFS was significantly shorter for patients with uncommon EGFR mutations compared with median PFS of those with common EGFR mutations (2.2 versus 11.4 months; p 0.001) (Fig. 3A). By contrast the median PFS did not differ significantly between patients with uncommon EGFR mutations and those with common EGFR mutations in the carboplatin-paclitaxel group (5.9 versus 5.4 months; p 0.847) (Fig. 3B). The objective response rate was significantly lower in patients with uncommon EGFR mutations compared with the objective response rate in those with common EGFR mutations when treated with gefitinib (20 versus 76 ; p 0.017) (supplementary Table S2 Supplemental Digital Content 1 http: links.lww.com JTO A494). By contrast similar objective response rates were observed for patients with uncommon EGFR mutations and those with common EGFR mutations in the carboplatin-paclitaxel group (20 versus 32 ; p 0.336) (supplementary Table S2 Supplemental Digital Content 1 http: links.lww.com JTO A494). FIGURE 3. Progression-free survival curves in the gefitinib group (A) and the carboplatin-paclitaxel group (B) according to the type of epidermal growth factor receptor mutation. DISCUSSION Recent studies suggest that NSCLC patients with uncommon EGFR mutations are less responsive to EGFR-TKIs compared with patients with L858R and exon 19 deletions.9 20 However the efficacy of EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC patients with uncommon mutations has not been fully elucidated. We conducted a post-hoc analysis of the NEJ002 study to evaluate the effectiveness of gefitinib against NSCLC with G719X or L861Q. The NEJ002 study comparing gefitinib and standard carboplatin-paclitaxel chemotherapy as the first-line treatment for patients with EGFR mutations demonstrated no significant difference in OS between gefitinib and carboplatin-paclitaxel.6 In contrast to other phase 3 trials investigating EGFR-TKIs for patients with common EGFR mutations of exon 19 deletion and L858R the NEJ002 is the only study that included uncommon EGFR mutations of G719X and L861Q. The current study clearly demonstrated that NSCLC patients with the uncommon EGFR mutations G719X and L861Q had shorter survival than the survival of those with an exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation (Fig. 2). Our results are consistent with other clinical studies on EGFR-TKIs in patients with uncommon EGFR mutations (supplementary Table S3 Supplemental Digital Content 1 http: links.lww.com JTO A494). The overall response rate to EGFR-TKIs in patients with uncommon EGFR mutations was 41 which is lower than the response rate to TKIs (62 83 ) of patients with common EGFR mutations.7824 In the NEJ002 study G719X included G719C and G719S. No patients harbored G719A. To investigate the effectiveness of gefitinib on each uncommon EGFR mutations we evaluated the difference in OS between patients with uncommon EGFR mutations (G719C versus G719S and G719X versus L861Q). There was no significant difference between these subgroups (data not shown). This study showed that the PFS and OS tended to be shorter among patients treated with first-line gefitinib compared with PFS and OS among those treated with first-line carboplatin-paclitaxel in the uncommon EGFR mutation group (supplementary Table S2 Supplemental Digital Content 1 http: links.lww.com JTO A494). We also found poor disease control rate with gefitinib in patients with uncommon mutations. Three of five patients with uncommon mutations in the gefitinib group had progressive disease. By contrast no patients with uncommon mutations had progressive disease in the carboplatin-paclitaxel group. Although the number of patients with uncommon mutations in each treatment group was small platinum-doublet therapy might be a better choice than gefitinib for first-line therapy in patients with uncommon EGFR mutations. Because some of patients with uncommon mutations showed good clinical response to gefitinib in this study and they seemed to be heterogeneous in terms of response to gefitinib administration of gefitinib should be considered for patients with uncommon mutations when disease progression was observed after first-line chemotherapy. In vitro studies have indicated that the affinity of gefitinib for EGFR proteins with uncommon EGFR mutations is lower than the affinity of gefitinib for EGFR proteins with common EGFR mutations.25 A sixfold or 14-fold higher concentration of gefitinib was required to inhibit the growth of cells expressing G719X or L861Q respectively compared with cells expressing L858R.26 These results may explain the lack of response to gefitinib in patients with uncommon EGFR mutations. The authors also examined the sensitivity of G719X and L861Q mutations to erlotinib and irreversible TKIs.27 Cells expressing G719X were less resistant to erlotinib than gefitinib in vitro; however L861Q was resistant to both erlotinib and gefitinib. In contrast to erlotinib irreversible TKIs inhibited the growth of cells with G719X or L861Q at a lower concentration than those with wild-type EGFR. Indeed Sequist et al.28 reported that the effectiveness of an irreversible pan-ErbB receptor TKI neratinib on NSCLC patients with G719X. Niratinib induced partial responses in three of four patients with G719X and the fourth had durable stable disease for 40 weeks. It may be beneficial to evaluate erlotinib as a treatment for NSCLCs with G719X and irreversible EGFR-TKIs as treatments for NSCLCs with G719X and L861Q. Because previous phase 3 trials that investigated erlotinib or irreversible TKIs for NSCLC with EGFR mutations did not include uncommon EGFR mutations further clinical studies may need to be performed.7829 Another possible strategy for the treatment of uncommon EGFR mutations is the combination of EGFR-TKIs and cytotoxic agents. Our group has undertaken a randomized phase 3 trial to compare gefitinib plus carboplatin plus pemetrexed with gefitinib monotherapy for patients with NSCLC with an exon 19 deletion or an L858R G719X or L861Q EGFR mutation (NEJ009; University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trials Registry UMIN-CTR number UMIN000006340). The data from this study will advance the treatment of NSCLC with uncommon EGFR mutations. In conclusion our post-hoc analysis clearly demonstrated shorter survival of TKI-treated patients with uncommon EGFR mutations compared with survival of those with common EGFR mutations. Furthermore the data suggest that the first-line chemotherapy may be relatively effective for NSCLC with uncommon EGFR mutations.

Questions purposes We hypothesized that a less intensive followup protocol would not be inferior to the conventional followup protocol in terms of OS. We (1) assessed OS of patients to determine if less intensive followup regimens led to worsened survival and asked (2) whether chest radiograph followup group was inferior to CT scan followup group in detecting pulmonary metastasis; and (3) whether less frequent (6-monthly) followup interval was inferior to more frequent (3-monthly) followup in detecting pulmonary metastasis and local recurrence. Methods A prospective randomized single-center noninferiority trial was conducted between January 2006 and June 2010. On the basis of 3-year survival of 60 with intensive more frequent followup 500 nonmetastatic patients were randomized to demonstrate noninferiority by a margin (delta) of 10 (hazard ratio HR 1.36). The primary end point was OS at 3 years. The secondary objective was to compare disease-free survival (DFS) (time to recurrence) at 3 years. At minimum followup of 30 months (median 42 months; range 30 81 months) 178 deaths were documented. Results Three-year OS and DFS for all patients was 67 and 52 respectively. Three-year OS was 67 and 66 in chest radiography and CT groups respectively (HR 0.9; upper 90 confidence interval CI 1.13). DFS rate was 54 and 49 in chest radiography and CT groups respectively (HR 0.82; upper 90 CI 0.97). Three-year OS was 64 and 69 in 6-monthly and 3-monthly groups respectively (HR 1.2; upper 90 CI 1.47). DFS was 51 and 52 in 6-monthly and 3-monthly groups respectively (HR 1.01; upper 90 CI 1.2). Almost 90 of local recurrences were identified by patients themselves. Conclusions Inexpensive imaging detects the vast majority of recurrent disease in patients with sarcoma without deleterious effects on eventual outcomes. Patient education regarding self-examination will detect most instances of local recurrence although this was not directly assessed in this study. Although less frequent visits adequately detected metastasis and local recurrence this trial could not conclusively demonstrate noninferiority in OS for a 6-monthly interval of followup visits against 3-monthly visits.

Here we describe the effects of genetic variants on the DNA methylome in human lung based on methylation-quantitative trait loci (meQTL) analyses. We report 34304 cis- and 585 trans-meQTLs a genetic-epigenetic interaction of surprising magnitude including a regulatory hotspot. These findings are replicated in both breast and kidney tissues and show distinct patterns: cis-meQTLs mostly localize to CpG sites outside of genes promoters and CpG islands (CGIs) while trans-meQTLs are over-represented in promoter CGIs. meQTL SNPs are enriched in CTCF binding sites DNaseI hypersensitivity regions and histone marks. Importantly 4 of the 5 established lung cancer risk loci in European ancestry are cis-meQTLs and in aggregate cis-meQTLs are enriched for lung cancer risk in a genome-wide analysis of 11587 subjects. Thus inherited genetic variation may affect lung carcinogenesis by regulating the human methylome. Introduction DNA methylation plays a central role in epigenetic regulation. Twin studies have suggested that DNA methylation at specific CpG sites can be heritable12; however the genetic effects on DNA methylation have been investigated only in brain tissues34 adipose tissues56 and lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL)7. Most studies were based on the Illumina HumanMethylation27 array which has a low density and mainly focuses on CpG-sites mapping to gene promoter regions. While the functional role of DNA methylation in non-promoter or non-CpG Island (CGI) regions remains largely unknown evidence shows roles in regulating gene splicing8 and alternative promoters9 silencing of intragenic repetitive DNA sequences10 and predisposing to germline and somatic mutations that could contribute to cancer development1112. Notably a recent study13 suggests that most DNA methylation alterations in colon cancer occur outside of promoters or CGIs in so called CpG island shores and shelves and the Cancer Genome Project has reported high mutation rates in CpG regions outside CGI in multiple cancers14. Although expression QTLs (eQTLs) have been extensively studied in different cell lines and tissues15 the minimal overlap observed between cis-acting meQTLs and eQTLs (?5 10 )347 emphasizes the necessity of mapping meQTLs that may function independently of nearby gene expression. This might reveal novel mechanisms for genetic effects on cancer risk particularly since many of the established cancer susceptibility SNPs map to non-genic regions. Lung diseases constitute a significant public health burden. About 10 million Americans had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in 201216 and lung cancer continues to be the leading cancer-related cause of mortality worldwide17. To provide functional annotation of SNPs particularly those relevant to lung diseases and traits we systematically mapped meQTLs in 210 histologically normal human lung tissues using Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip arrays which provide a comprehensive platform to interrogate the DNA methylation status of 485512 cytosine targets with excellent coverage in both promoter and non-promoter regions (Fig. 1a) CGI and non-CGI regions (Fig. 1b) and gene and non-gene regions. Thus our study enables the characterization of genetic effects across the methylome in unprecedented detail. Moreover since DNA methylation exhibits tissue specific features18 we investigated whether similar meQTLs could be identified in other tissues. Results Identification of cis-acting meQTLs We profiled DNA methylation for 244 fresh-frozen histologically normal lung samples from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients from the Environment and Genetics in Lung cancer Etiology (EAGLE) study19. A subset of 210 tissue samples that passed quality control and had germline genotype data from blood samples20 was used for meQTL analysis. The analysis was restricted to 338456 autosomal CpG probes after excluding those annotated in repetitive genomic regions or that harbored genetic variants. The distribution of methylation levels differed strongly across distinct types of genomic regions (Supplementary Fig. 1ab). Consistent with previous studies21 CpG sites in promoter or CGI regions were largely unmethylated while those in other regions were largely methylated (Supplementary Fig. 1ab). We performed cis-meQTL analysis for each methylation trait by searching for SNPs within 500kb of the target CpG-site in each direction (1Mb overall). The genetic association was tested under an additive model between each SNP and each normalized methylation probe adjusting for sex age plate population stratification and methylation-based principal component analysis (PCA) scores. Controlling FDR at 5 (P 4.0Ã 10?5) we detected cis-meQTLs for 34304 (10.1 of 338456) CpG probes (Supplementary ) mapping to 9330 genes. A more stringent threshold (P 6.0Ã 10?6) at FDR 1 detected cis-meQTLs for 27043 CpG probes mapping to 8479 genes. Moreover with a 200kb window (100kb from both sides) instead than 1Mb we detected 40650 cis-meQTLs (P 2.0Ã 10?4) controlling for FDR 5 . The methylation distribution in CpG sites detected with meQTLs differed substantially from those without meQTLs (Supplementary Fig. 1ab). The peak SNPs were equally distributed on either side of the target CpG-sites with a median distance (?) of 11.8 kb. The proportion of explained phenotypic variance (h2) ranged from 7.7 to 79.8 (Supplementary Fig. 1c)\nLabels: [Thyroid_Cancer, Colon_Cancer, Lung_Cancer]\nReply with one label only.", "assistant": "Lung_Cancer"}

COPD: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; Sq: squamous cell carcinoma; NSCLC: non-small cell lung carcinoma; SCLC: small cell lung carcinoma; Large: large cell carcinoma; EGFR: epidermal growth factor receptor. Regarding pathologic findings the incidence of adenocarcinoma was significantly lower in the COPD group than in the non-COPD group. In the present study EGFR mutation was observed only in the patients with adenocarcinoma (40 145 cases; 27.6 ). In contrast the number of cases in which EGFR mutation status was not determined was significantly higher in the COPD group than in the non-COPD group. Although determination of the clinical stage should be essential in order to propose the therapeutic options for lung cancer some cases in which clinical staging had not been completed were observed in the study population. The number of these cases was significantly higher in the COPD group than in the non-COPD group. In contrast the proportion of patients with each classification in the clinical staging did not differ between the two groups besides the cases in which the clinical staging was not determined. Among the total study population the number of thoracic surgeries performed was significantly lower in the COPD group than in the non-COPD group. Critical impact of the severity of airflow obstruction on the decision to propose thoracic surgery with curative intent To explore whether or not the severity of airflow obstruction might affect the decision to propose thoracic surgery with curative intent patients at stage 3B and 4 were excluded from the analysis because they were not eligible for thoracic surgery. In addition patients for whom the clinical staging had not been completed were also excluded. As a result we evaluated data from 185 patients with lung cancer at stage 1A to 3A who underwent spirometry and bronchoscopy. These patients were subdivided into those who underwent thoracic surgery (135 cases) and those who did not (50 cases). The characteristics and spirometric data for the patients with or without thoracic surgery are summarized in Tables 4 and 5. The characteristics of lung cancer among these groups are also shown in . Univariate analysis identified a significantly lower frequency of thoracic surgery among the patients of greater age and with more severe airway obstruction and advanced clinical staging. Univariate analysis also identified a significantly higher frequency of thoracic surgery among patients with adenocarcinoma. Finally all of the factors with a significant association in the univariate analysis were applied to the multivariate model to identify variables independently associated with the decision for thoracic surgery. Multivariate analysis identified more severe airway obstruction advanced clinical stagings and higher age as independent factors affecting the decision on thoracic surgery ().\nLabels: [Thyroid_Cancer, Colon_Cancer, Lung_Cancer]\nReply with one label only.", "assistant": "Lung_Cancer"}

untranslated region ²utr fig a05a to verify this hypothesis we transfected both the h520 and hcc95 cells with mir or mir214 inhibitors and yap1 mrna and protein levels were measured results showed that the mir214 oe significantly decreased yap1 mrna and protein levels in both cell lines while mir214 knockdown kd led to increased yap1 expression fig a0 5c and d furthermore to determine the direct binding site between the mir2143p and yap1 we performed a luciferase assay then we constructed the wild type of and mutated seed sequences in the ² utr of yap1 mrna the yap1wt3²utr and its mutant type yap1mt3²utr were amplified and cloned downstream of a luciferase reporter gene in the pgl3basic vector the luciferase reporter experiment revealed that the cotransfection of pcdnamir214 and yap1wt3²utr in h520 and hcc95 cells remarkably inhibited luciferase activity compared to the nc cells fig a05b however there was no difference in the luciferase activity in cells that cotransfected with yap1mt3²utr and pcdnamir214 fig a0 5b therefore we confirmed that mir2143p directly targets yap1 by specifically binding on the ² utr of yap1 in lscc cell linesrescue experiments illustrated that a0yap1 liberated the a0growth and a0csc properties inhibited by a0mir these findings encouraged us to explore whether the mir2143p repressed lscc growth and csc properties via yap1 our previous work revealed that yap1 kd remarkably decreased sphere and colony formations and aldehyde dehydrogenase gene aldh proportion preveiously our group have proved that yap1 kd substantially reduced stemrelated genes levels of lung cancer cells these results suggested that yap1 kd could mimic the role of mir2143p oe our findings above confirmed that silenced yap1 led to the same phenotypes as mir2143p oe did implying that mir2143p inhibited proliferation and csc phenotype via yap1 to validate this hypothesis we performed a subsequent rescue experiment in h520 and hcc95 cells cells transfected with mir214 were transduced with a pcdna31yap1 plasmid interestingly yap1 oe partially rescued the proliferation capacity inhibited by the mir214 fig a06a the yap1 plasmid transduction liberated the inhibited growths of mir2143p oe colonies and spheres fig a06b and c we also found that reintroduction of yap1 rescued the reductions of cscspecific markers in both h520 and hcc95 cell lines fig a06d in addition the reintroduction of yap1 rescued the reductions of vimentin and snail protein expressions caused by the mir2143p oe fig a0 6e furthermore in mice models the restoration of yap1 expression significantly liberated the decreased proliferation and selfrenewal abilities caused by the mir2143p oe in lscc fig a06fdiscussionthis study confirmed that yap1 was overexpressed while mir2143p was downregulated in lscc tissues which was inversely correlated with each other the km survival curves indicated that patients with high mir214 expression possessed better clinical outcomes than those with low expression in this case we initially reported that the mir2143p strongly modulated csc phenotypes of lscc in a0vitro and in a0vivo we provided robust evidence on how mir2143p served as a tumor suppressor and a promising target in therapies against lscc because it imitated and displayed excellent antitumor efficacylike many other mirnas mir214 has reportedly been abnormally expressed in various tumors it plays a dual role by modulating tumor initiation based on the tumor types either as oncogenes or tumor suppressors as a tumor suppressor mir214 represses tumor progression in hepatocellular gastric ovarian and cervical cancers however it is also reported to promote tumor migration in melanoma furthermore mir214 acts as either an oncogene or a suppressor depending on the genetic or the cancer type interestingly in lung cancer wu et a0 al reported that mir214 oe significantly diminished the migration and invasion of nonsmall cell lung cancer nsclc cells while long et a0al found that mir214 expression contributed to epithelial mesenchymal transition emt and metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma however the impact and regulatory mechanisms of mir214 in lscc remain to be extensively exploredwe demonstrated the role of mir214 as a tumor suppressor and how mir214 impaired the csc properties of lscc by gain and lossoffunction assays to our knowledge the crucial role of mirna is to regulate the 0clu a0et a0al cancer cell int page of 0clu a0et a0al cancer cell int page of expression of its downstream genes through the mrna cleavage andor by inhibition of translation depending on the extent of complementarity with the ²utr of target genes our group previously confirmed that the mir2143p was downregulated whereas yap1 was upregulated in lscc tissues in this context we reported that mir214 was inversely correlated with yap1 which stimulated our attention and interest further investigations validated our hypothesis that yap1 was a direct downstream gene of mir214 in lscc first mir214 oe evidently reduced yap1 mrna and protein expression in lscc second ectopic mir214 levels significantly impaired a luciferase reporter s activity which contains the ²utr sequence of yap1 third rescue experiments showed that yap1 reexpression abrogated the antitumor effect of mir214 on lscc to a certain extentto conclude mir214 acts as a critical regulator of csc properties in lscc we also reported that mir inhibited lscc proliferation and csc capacities via targeting yap1 to activate the hippo signaling pathway the identification of tumorspecific mirnas and target genes is necessary to understand the underlying mechanisms of lscc initiation this is of great value to design new strategies in the future mir2143p might become a promising prognostic marker finally targeting the mir214yap1 axis could be identified as a promising strategy in lsccour data revealed that mir214 could inhibit lscc cell proliferation through the hippo signaling pathway collectively these findings provide new insight into the role of mir214 which might serve as a novel therapeutic target for lscc

{"system": "You are a medical text classifier. Choose exactly one label.", "user": "Text: In this model the lymphangiogenesis induced by PDGF-BB could not be restricted by blocking interaction of VEGF-C with VEGFR-3 suggesting that PDGF-BB exerts its effect via an independent pathway that may involve PDGF receptors on lymphatic vessels 34 . Another study showed that VEGF-C is an essential regulator determining PDGF-BB expression for vascular stabilization via a paracrine mode of action 22 . The stimulation of proliferation of lymphatic endothelial cells by platelets seems to be induced in a time and dose dependent manner mainly by VEGF-C and PDGF-BB which are secreted by platelets. Blocking the experiments indicate a predominant role of VEGF-C in this process 35 . All those results suggested that both factors play complicated roles in tumor lymphangiogenesis. However the overlapping biological effects of these two factors have not been clarified clearly in human cancers. In this study overexpression of both PDGF-BB and VEGF-C significantly correlated. LMVD. Those cases were also younger and had larger tumor size more likely lymph node metastasis worse histological differentiation and poorer OS. In addition a significant association between VEGF-C overexpression alone and worse histological differentiation was found. For the rest however PDGF-BB or VEGF-C alone was not linked to any other clinical feature including LMVD. The results indicated NSCLC patients who had overexpression of both PDGF-BB and VEGF-C might present with more rapid growth and higher potential for invasion due to their lymphangiogenesis. Thereby these patients had poorer OS which was consistent with the results in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma those with positive expressions of PDGF-BB and VEGF-C have been shown to possess a worse prognosis compared to those with negative expressions 23 . Also those results suggested that poorly differentiated cancer cells might be more capable to secrete VEGF-C and PDGF-BB which induced lymphangiogenesis thereby promoting disease progression in NSCLC. The secretion of VEGF-C or PDGF-BB by tumor could induce the activation of their receptors on the vascular endothelium and thereby inducing the formation of new lymphatic vessels 36 . However little is currently known about the interplay among these lymphangiogenic factors. In this study a significant positive correlation between PDGF-BB and VEGF-C protein expression of tumor cells was seen in NSCLC suggesting a lymphangiogenesis pathway that one factor (PDGF-BB or VEGF-C alone) may up-regulate the other factor expression in the same cells. Therefore we suspected that PDGF-BB and VEGF-C could synergistically promote NSCLC lymphangiogenesis and enhance the tumor growth and lymph node metastasis. Combined targeting both PDGF-BB and VEGF-C may become a promising strategy for the treatment of NSCLC. Conclusions We found for the first time that compared with the overexpression of PDGF-BB or VEGF-C alone both PDGF-BB and VEGF-C overexpression in primary human NSCLC was significantly associated with lymphangiogensis and poor outcome. Furthermore our data suggested that PDGF-BB and VEGF-C expression might have a correlative dependence and interplay not only in NSCLC lymphangiogenesis but also in cancer progression. Based on the expression of PDGF-BB and VEGF-C we speculated the therapy targeting VEGF-C expression in combination with targeting PDGF-BB might be an important approach for control the cancer growth in patients with NSCLC having high expression of both PDGF-BB and VEGF-C.

These results suggested that Sp1 is involved in miR-182 transcriptional activation. Using the TFSEARCH software we analyzed the miR-182 promoter and identified two putative Sp1 binding elements. Consequently recruitment of Sp1 to the miR-182 promoter was examined (E and 1F). Acetyl-histone3 was recruited to the Sp1 binding elements indicating that the region could recruit TFs (E panel b). Sp1 was also recruited to the miR-182 promoter (E panel c and panel d and 1F). When the Sp1 binding element at site 1 was mutated luciferase activity driven by the miR-182 promoter was abolished but no change was observed when the other Sp1 binding site was mutated indicating that the Sp1 binding element at site 1 is important for the Sp1-mediated expression of miR-182 (G). Sp1 regulates miR-182 expression (A) Scramble (shScr) and different doses of Sp1 shRNAs (shSp1) were transfected into A549 for 48 h. The miR-182 level was determined by stem-loop RT-PCR. U6 served as the internal control (panel a). Data were quantified after three independent experiments (panel b). (B) Different titer of adeno-GFP-Sp1 virus was infected IMR-90 cells for 48 h.

(C) Plasmids pGL2 or pGL2-miR-182 (-1000 50) and GFP or GFP-Sp1 were co-transfected into H1299 cells for 24h. Cells were harvested to study the luciferase activity. Data were quantified after three independent experiments. (D) The plasmids pGL2 or pGL2-miR-182 were transfected into H1299 cells with mithramycin A treatment for 24 h. Cells were harvested for luciferase activity assays. (E) Schematic diagram indicates the location of putative Sp1 binding sites on miR-182 promoter region (panel a). ChIP assays were performed with anti-acetyl-H3 (panel b) and anti-Sp1 antibodies (panel c). DNA was extracted for PCR with miR-182 and p21 primers. Data were quantified after three independent experiments (panel d). (F) A549 cells were harvested for DAPA with a biotin-conjugated p21 and miR-182 promoter probes and samples were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-Sp1 antibodies (panel a). Data were quantified after three independent experiments (panel b). (G) Plasmids GFP or GFP-Sp1 were co-transfected with pGL2 pGL2-miR-182 WT or mutation plasmids into H1299 cells for 24 h and then cells were harvested for luciferase activity assays. Data are representative of three independent experiments each of which was performed in triplicate and presented as the mean SEM. The level of statistical significance determined by t-test ( p 0.05; p 0.01). Because Sp1 is highly expressed in lung cancer we studied the expression of Sp1 and miR-182 in various lung cancer cell lines and patient samples (). Compared with normal human lung cells (BEAS-2B) lung cancer cell lines expressed higher levels of miR-182 (A). We also assessed the correlation between the miR-182 and Sp1 expression patterns. Sp1 levels in clinical lung tissue samples were highly elevated in the tumorous sections of the lung accompanied by increased expression of miR-182 (B). To confirm this result Sp1 and miR-182 levels were measured in 32 lung cancer patients. Sp1 and miR-182 were upregulated by more than 1.3-fold in 59.4 of the lung adenocarcinoma specimens when compared to expression in normal tissue (C). These results indicate that Sp1 expression positively correlates with miR-182 expression (D). The miR-182 level correlates to Sp1 level Total RNA and cell lysates were prepared from indicated cell lines (A) or from clinical lung tissues of lung cancer patients (B). The miR-182 level was determined by stem-loop RT-PCR and Sp1 level was studied by Western blotting with anti-Sp1 antibodies. U6 and tubulin served as the internal control. (C) Total RNA and cell lysates were prepared from 32 paired normal lung tissues and lung adenocarcinoma samples. The miR-182 level was studied by stem-loop RT-PCR and Sp1 levels were studied by RT-PCR. (D) The relationship between Sp1 and the miR-182 level in the 32 lung cancer samples was statistically analyzed using Fisher's exact test. miR-182 increases lung tumor growth The data shown in indicated that Sp1 regulated miR-182 expression during lung tumorigenesis. To identify the specific gene targets of miR-182 we searched public miRNA target prediction databases (miRDB miRWalk and TargetScanHuman) for candidate target genes. By combining the data from these three databases we identified 161 genes potentially regulated by miR-182 (Supplementary Figure S1A). Moreover pathway analysis using Ingenuity software indicated that the cellular growth and proliferation pathway had the highest score when the association of these 161 genes with biological pathways was examined. This suggests that miR-182 may play a functional role in cancer-associated processes (Supplementary Figure S1B). Indeed when miR-182 was knocked down with miRZip-182 shRNA the percentage of cells in G2 M and sub-G1 phases increased suggesting that miR-182 positively regulated cell cycle progression in the lung cancer cells (A). To further elucidate miR-182's effect on the cell cycle cells were synchronized at prometaphase using nocodazole treatment. After removing nocodazole more miRZip-182 than miRZip cells remained in G2 M phase providing further evidence that miR-182 positively regulates cell cycle progression (B). Consistently knockdown of miR-182 expression inhibited cell growth (C). miR-182 increases cancer cell proliferation (A) The miRZip and miRZip-182 stably expressed H1299 cells were fixed with 70 ethanol and stained with propidium iodide for cell cycle analysis by FACS. (B) Mitotic cells were released into growth by removing nocodazole then fixed at indicated time points for cell cycle progression assay by FACS. (C) The growth rates of miRZip and miRZip-182 stably expressed H1299 cells were calculated by cell counting within 5 days. Data are representative of six independent experiments and presented as the mean SEM. (D) Bioluminescent imaging was performed on 10 severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice implanted with miRZip and miRZip-182 stable expression H1299 cells (106 cells mouse) at day 14 (panel a) then image signal was analyzed using Living Image software and presented as total flux measurements in photons second (panel b). (E) Tumors from SCID mice implanted with miRZip and miRZip-182 stable expression H1299 cells for 4 weeks are shown (panel a) and tumor weights were analyzed (panel b). Data are representative of ten independent experiments and are presented as the mean SEM. The level of statistical significance determined by t-test ( p 0.05; p 0.01; p 0.001). To confirm the effect of miR-182 on tumor formation cells stably expressing with miRZip or miRZip-182 were implanted into SCID mice and tumor growth was monitored in vivo (D). The miRZip lentivector contains a copGFP gene and the GFP signal in miRZip-182-expressing cells was lower than that in miRZip control cells (D). Furthermore tumor volume and tumor weight were also lower in miRZip-182-implanted mice than in miRZip-implanted mice (N 10 per group) (E). These results suggest that miR-182 overexpression facilitates lung tumor growth in vivo. Sp1 inhibits FOXO3 expression by inducing miR-182 expression To investigate the molecular mechanism underlying miR-182-mediated cancer cell proliferation we studied an important miR-182 target gene FOXO3. FOXO3 expression was higher in cells stably expressing miRZip-182 than in control cells (A). Knockdown of miR-182 expression enhanced the luciferase activity of a pGL3 vector containing the 3?-UTR of FOXO3 (B) indicating that miR-182 downregulated FOXO3 expression. Further to determine whether Sp1 downregulated FOXO3 expression through miR-182 GFP-Sp1 was expressed in cells stably expressing miRZip-182 (C). Overexpression of GFP-Sp1 reduced FOXO3 protein expression in miRZip stable cells but increased FOXO3 levels in miRZip-182-expressing cells implying that different effect of Sp1 is existed on the regulation of FOXO3 expression. Regulation of FOXO3 by miR-182 and Sp1 (A) Lenti-miRZip and lenti-miRZip-182 viruses were infected into H1299 for 96 h individually. FOXO3 level was studied by Western blotting with anti-FOXO3 antibodies and miR-182 level was studied by stem-loop RT-PCR. (B) Plasmids pGL3 and pGL3-FOXO3-3'UTR were transfected into miRZip and miRZip-182 stably expressed H1299 cells for 24 h and then cells were harvested for luciferase activity assays. (C) Different doses of GFP-Sp1 adenovirus were infected into the miRZip and miRZip-182 stably expressed H1299 cells for 48 h. FOXO3 level was studied by Western blotting using anti-FOXO3 antibodies (panel a). Quantitative results from three independent experiments are shown (panel b). The level of statistical significance was determined by t-test ( p 0.05; p 0.001). Therefore we further investigated the relationship between Sp1 and miR-182 in the context of FOXO3 regulation. The expression of Sp1 and FOXO3 in patients with lung cancer was examined (Figure 5A). In normal tissue samples Sp1 levels were low and FOXO3 levels were high. In tumor tissue samples two Sp1 expression patterns i.e. high and low Sp1 expression were identified. Samples with higher Sp1 levels exhibited lower FOXO3 levels whereas samples with lower Sp1 levels exhibited higher FOXO3 levels suggesting that there is an inverse correlation between Sp1 and FOXO3 levels in lung specimen (Figure 5A). The levels of FOXO3 and Sp1 in the lung cancer cell lines A549 H1299 CL 1-0 and CL 1-5 were studied (Figure 5B). Higher levels of Sp1 expression were accompanied by lower levels of FOXO3 expression in A549 and CL 1-0 cells and lower levels of Sp1 expression were accompanied by higher levels of FOXO3 expression in H1299 and CL 1-5 cells suggesting that there is an inverse correlation between Sp1 and FOXO3 expression in lung tumorigenesis. Overexpression of GFP-Sp1 decreased FOXO3 mRNA and protein levels in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 5C panel a) whereas knockdown of Sp1 expression increased FOXO3 mRNA and protein levels (Figure 5C panel b). These results indicate that Sp1 negatively regulates FOXO3 expression. Figure 5 Sp1 negatively regulates FOXO3 expression through regulating miR-182 (A) The Sp1 and FOXO3 levels in clinical lung tissue samples were studied by IHC staining using antibodies against Sp1 and FOXO3 respectively. (B) Cell lysates were harvested from various cell lines for Western blotting using antibodies against FOXO3 and Sp1 and tubulin as an internal control. (C) Adeno-GFP-Sp1 viruses were infected into IMR-90 cells for 48 h and FOXO3 mRNA and protein were studied by RT-PCR and Western blotting respectively. GAPDH served as the internal control (panel a). Scramble and Sp1 shRNAs were transfected into H1299 for 48 h then FOXO3 mRNA and protein levels were studied by RT-PCR and Western blotting (panel b). (D) Scramble and Sp1 shRNAs were transfected into H1299 for 48 h and then cells were harvested at indicated time points following cycloheximide treatment for studying the Sp1 and FOXO3 levels with Western blotting. The levels of FOXO3 protein from three independent experiments were quantified using tubulin as an internal control. (E) Plasmids pGL2 or pGL2-FOXO3 (-1000 50) were cotransfected with GFP or GFP-Sp1 into H1299 cells for 24 h then cell lysates were harvested for luciferase activity assays. (F) Adeno-GFP-Sp1 viruses were infected into H1299 cells for 24 h and cells were then transfected with pGL3 or pGL3-FOXO3-3'UTR plasmid for 24 h. Cells lysates were harvested for luciferase activity assays. (G) H1299 cells which were infected with GFP-Sp1 adenovirus for 24 h were then transfected with pGL3 or pGL3-FOXO3-3'UTR plasmid for 24 h. Total RNA was extracted at various time points following actinomycin D treatment. The mRNA levels of luciferase were determined by using quantitative RT-PCR and quantified using GAPDH as an internal control. Data are representative of three independent experiments each of which was performed in triplicate and presented as the mean SEM. The level of statistical significance determined by t-test ( p 0.05; p 0.01). Next we investigated the mechanism by which Sp1 regulates FOXO3 expression. FOXO3 protein half-life was studied after Sp1 knockdown. Knockdown of Sp1 expression did not affect FOXO3 protein stability (Figure 5D). We then constructed a luciferase reporter construct containing the FOXO3 promoter (-1000 50) to study the effect of Sp1 on the promoter-mediated transcription of FOXO3 (Figure 5E). GFP-Sp1 overexpression significantly enhanced the luciferase activity indicating that Sp1 positively regulated FOXO3 transcription (Figure 5E). However FOXO3 mRNA and protein levels decreased as shown in Figure 5C. The data shown in indicated that Sp1 increased miR-182 expression which suggests that post-transcriptional processing contributes to the regulation of FOXO3 expression. Thus the 3'-UTR of FOXO3 might play an important role in stabilizing FOXO3 mRNA and in FOXO3 translation. Consequently a luciferase reporter construct containing the 3?-UTR of FOXO3 was generated. GFP-Sp1 overexpression reduced the luciferase activity (Figure 5F). Furthermore the stability of the luciferase mRNA containing the 3?-UTR sequence of FOXO3 decreased dramatically upon GFP-Sp1 overexpression (Figure 5G). These results indicate that Sp1 regulates FOXO3 expression through transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation with a net negative effect on FOXO3 expression. miR-182 inhibits lung cancer metastasis activity The data shown in indicated that miR-182 positively regulated lung cancer cell growth. Therefore the role of miR-182 in lung cancer metastasis was studied (Figure 6). The morphology of miRZip-182 cells was markedly altered: circular structures of actin filaments were absence and pseudopodia were enriched suggesting that miR-182 decreased the cells' migratory ability (Figure 6A). Indeed knockdown of miR-182 expression increased the migration ability of lung cancer cells suggesting that miR-182 inhibits lung cancer migration (Figure 6B). Moreover transwell migration assays showed that knockdown of miR-182 expression enhanced cell's invasive capacity (Figure 6C). In mice injected with miRZip-182-treated cells the knockdown of miR-182 expression also increased the number of nodules in the lung suggesting that miR-182 represses metastatic ability in vivo (Figure 6D). The effects of miR-182 knockdown were partially reversed by knockdown of FOXO3 suggesting that miR-182 functions as a suppressor of lung cancer metastasis by repressing FOXO3 expression (Figure 6E panel a). The endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) marker N-cadherin increased after miR-182 knockdown but this effect was abolished by FOXO3 knockdown. Thus miR-182 might repress lung cancer metastasis by decreasing the expression of N-cadherin (Figure 6E panel b). However the expression of other genes regulated by miR-182 might also play a role in metastasis (Figure 6F and Supplementary Figure S3). Therefore we generated gene expression profiles using microarray analysis. Functional grouping analysis using DAVID bioinformatics resources showed that 19 of the genes differentially regulated by miR-182 knockdown were related to cell migration. The expression of these genes was increased in miR-182-knockdown cells indicating that they are potential targets of miR-182 (Figure 6F). Many metastasis-related genes such as CD44 CDH9 and ADAM9 were upregulated after the knockdown of miR-182 expression (Figure 6F). Figure 6 miR-182 attenuates lung cancer cell metastasis (A) Immunofluorescent staining of Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated phalloidin that is a high-affinity probe for F-actin (red) in miRZip and miRZip-182 stably expressed H1299 cells.

(D) The miRZip or miRZip-182 stably expressed H1299 cells (4 x 106) were suspended in 100 ?l of PBS and injected into the lateral tail vein of SCID mice. After 8 weeks all mice were killed and the number of pulmonary tumor nodules was calculated after fixation of lungs with 4 formaldehyde for 48 h (panel a) and the number of pulmonary metastatic tumor nodules was counted (panel b). (E) FOXO3 and miR-182 in H1299 cells were knockdown by shFOXO3 and miRZip-182 respectively and then migration of cells (3 x 104) was studies by Transwell chambers (panel a). In addition cell lysates were harvested from FOXO3 and miR-182 knockdown cells for Western blotting using antibodies against N-cadherin ?-catenin vimentin FOXO3 and tubulin (panel b) respectively. (F) Heat map of the 19 of genes from miRZip and miRZip-182 microarray data the red color represents genes that are upregulated and the green color represents genes that are downregulated.

DISCUSSION Our recent studies showed that Sp1 increased the growth of lung cancer cells but inhibits metastatic activity 23 32 . In the present study we found that Sp1 which accumulated in the early stages of cancer positively regulated miR-182 gene expression to silence FOXO3 expression and thereby promote cancer cell growth. In addition decreased levels of Sp1 in the late stages of cancer increased the expression of FOXO3 and N-cadherin leading to cancer metastasis (Figure 7). Figure 7 (A) Clinical samples from lung cancer patients of stage I and IV were used to study the Sp1 level by IHC staining with anti-Sp1 antibodies (B) Schematic diagram illustrates Sp1 regulates miR-182 to silence FOXO3 expression in early and late stages of lung cancer progression. Sp1 functions as a transcriptional activator by recruiting p300 to its target genes and as a repressor by the recruiting HDACs. Because Sp1 accumulates in several types of cancer including lung cancer 33 understanding the Sp1 transcriptional regulatory network may provide novel insights into the molecular origins and treatment of lung cancer. In our previous studies of lung cancer we found that Sp1 was highly upregulated in the early stages of cancer progression but partially down regulated in the late stages. Our previous studies also showed that regulation of Sp1 protein stability by phosphorylation and sumoylation contributed to its expression in the early and late stages of cancer respectively 32 . Kras activation and the Notch pathway might activate ERK1 2 to phosphorylate Sp1 thus stabilizing Sp1 in the early stages of cancer 32 34 . In the late stages Sp1 could be sumoylated leading to recruitment of its E3-ligase RNF4 followed by polyubiquitination and degradation 32 . To clarify the molecular mechanism underlying gene regulation by Sp1 we used microarray analysis to assess gene expression in KrasG12D-induced lung tumor transgenic mice and identified thousands of genes potentially regulated by Sp1 23 . However some of the genes do not harbor a conserved Sp1 binding motif within their promoter region suggesting that another regulatory mechanism is involved in Sp1-mediated gene regulation. In this study we identified a novel pathway for Sp1-mediated activation wherein miR-182 expression downregulated the expression of FOXO3 a known miR-182 target gene 35 . Sp1 activated miR-182 and FOXO3 at the transcriptional level; however FOXO3 protein expression decreased. These results suggest that post-transcriptional regulation by miRNAs is a powerful mechanism by which to control the final level of protein expression. Many coding genes with Sp1 binding element(s) in their promoters harbor conserved miRNA target sequences in their 3'-UTR. To our knowledge this is first study to demonstrate that Sp1 regulates the expression of a target gene by regulating promoter activity and post-transcriptional processing in parallel. Few studies have characterized the regulation of miRNA by Sp1. Herein using a bioinformatics approach we identified several miRNAs potentially regulated by Sp1 including miR-182. We then showed that Sp1 specifically targets the miR-182 promoter region and activates miR-182 expression. miR-182 reportedly forms a gene cluster with two adjacent miRNAs (miR-96 and miR-183) 35 . The expression of miR-96 and miR-183 also decreased following Sp1 knockdown (Supplementary Figure S2A). Moreover we also investigated the binding of Sp1 to the miR-212 promoter because the latter contains 13 putative Sp1 binding sites (Supplementary Table S1). We found that Sp1 bound to the miR-212 promoter sequence (Supplementary Figure S2B and S2C). Interestingly a recent study showed that FOXO3 is a direct target of miR-212 in the neurons of patients with Alzheimer's disease 36 . miR-182 and miR-212 might cooperate to downregulate FOXO3 expression upon Sp1 overexpression. We cannot rule out this possibility. However depletion of miR-182 was sufficient to impair the Sp1-mediated reduction of FOXO3 expression in our experiments (C) suggesting that miR-182 is the major regulator of FOXO3 in lung cancer cells. Several studies have shown that miR-182 is upregulated in lung cancer. This suggests that miR-182 plays a positive role in lung tumorigenesis. However in two studies of miR-182 function in lung cancer miR-182 inhibited the proliferation of human lung adenocarcinoma cells 37 38 . Our results in this study provide several pieces of evidence to support the notion that miRNA-182 is a positive regulator of lung cancer cell proliferation. Firstly miR-182 was upregulated in the majority of lung cancer clinical samples and lung cancer cell lines examined. Secondly miR-182 knockdown inhibited cell cycle progression and cell growth. Finally miR-182 knockdown reduced lung tumor growth in vivo. Discrepancies in the role of miRNA-182 in lung cancer cell proliferation might derive from the different experimental designs of the studies. For example because miR-182 expression is upregulated in lung cancer we knocked down its expression and examined the effects on cancer cell proliferation. However other studies that described a negative role of miR-182 in lung cancer used miR-182 overexpression to study miR-182's role in cancer cell proliferation. Overexpression conditions can alter the function of many genes 39 . For example Sp1 accumulates in most of cancers; knockdown of Sp1 expression decreases cell proliferation but Sp1 overexpression also attenuates cancer cell growth 40 . Because post-translational modifications affect protein function overexpressed proteins might not be completely processed which could affect their function. Previous studies in melanoma and hepatocellular carcinoma indicated that miR-182 enhanced tumor metastasis 35 41 . However our data as shown in Figure 6 indicated that miR-182 knockdown altered cell morphology and increased migration and invasion activities. In addition miR-182 knockdown increased N-cadherin levels suggesting that miR-182 promotes the mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) 42 . Previous studies have shown that TIMP-2 enhances the E-cadherin ?-catenin complex in A549 lung cancer cells 43 . Whether Sp1 or miR-182 regulates TIMP-1 in lung cancer needs to be addressed in future studies. Finally miR-182 levels were lower in CL1-5 cells then in CL1-0 cells resulting in increased metastatic activity in CL1-5. Collectively our data suggest that miR-182 inhibits lung cancer metastasis. Our previous study indicated that Sp1 is down regulated in the late stages of lung cancer progression 32 . Therefore in the late stages of lung tumorigenesis miR-182 expression was down regulated compared with expression in the early stages which led to tumor metastasis through at least in part an increase in FOXO3 expression. It is still not clear why miR-182 has different roles in different types of cancer; this awaits further study. Although we found that FOXO3 is involved in miR-182-mediated lung cancer progression FOXO3 knockdown did not completely abolish the effects of miR-182 knockdown suggesting that other genes regulated by miR-182 contribute to the inhibition of metastasis by miR-182. With this in mind we determined the expression profile of miR-182-regulated genes. Many metastasis-related genes were induced in miR-182-knockdown cells including CD44 ADAM9 and CDH9. CD44 which localizes to the cell membrane is reportedly involved in cell migration in various cancer types 44 . Recent studies also showed that tumor initiating cells with high CD44 expression maintained lung cancer tumorigenicity and drug resistance 45 . Another metastasis-related gene induced by miR-182 knockdown ADAM9 cleaves membrane proteins such as E-cadherin 46 . A previous study showed that combined Kras and Wnt pathway activation increased the incidence of lung cancer formation 47 . Given that ADAM9 is also involved in the activation of the Wnt pathway Sp1 and miR-182 might connect the Kras and the Wnt pathway. In addition CDH9 also involves in the cancer metastasis 48 . In conclusion we showed that miR-182 is an Sp1-activated miRNA whose expression increased in lung cancer. miR-182 functioned not only as an oncomiR for lung cancer growth but also as a suppressor of lung cancer metastasis. MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell culture and transfection Human lung cancer cell lines A549 H1299 CL 1-0 and 1-5 were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen Carlsbad CA) human diploid fibroblasts IMR were cultured in Minimum Essential Media (Invitrogen) and human bronchial epithelial cells BEAS-2B was cultured in RPMI 1640 Medium (Thermo Scientific Rockford IL). All of culture mediums contained 10 fetal bovine serum 100 U ml penicillin G sodium and 100 ?g ml streptomycin sulfate (Invitrogen). Cells were cultured at 37? and 5 CO2. Transfection of all cells with expression vectors was done using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's directions. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and stem-loop RT-PCR Total RNA was isolated using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and 3 ?g of RNA were reverse-transcribed using the Superscript III enzyme (Invitrogen).

In previous studies we have shown that thiaminase has both in vitro and in vivo cytotoxicity activity further supporting the concept that TDEs could represent new targets for novel therapies 6 7 8 . We have also previously reported that rapamycin has antagonistic effect on thiaminase-mediated growth inhibition of leukemia cells 7 a surprising finding since rapamycin generally acts as a sensitizing agent in combination with cytotoxic drugs. We now present metabolic and metabolomic observations regarding the anticancer activities and metabolic effects of thiaminase in leukemia and breast cancer cells. We chose to focus on breast and leukemia models because these were the models in which we observed the most promising activity of thiaminase in xenografts. These studies help define thiaminase metabolic effects that may be responsible for its cytotoxic activity. These studies also further elucidate the role of mTOR as an inhibitor of thiaminase-mediated alterations in cellular metabolism and demonstrate the role of mTOR in regulating expression of enzymes involved in thiamine-dependent metabolism. Methods Ethics statement All animal studies were approved by the University of Kentucky Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Cell Lines The human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 and the non-malignant breast cell line MCF-10A were obtained from ATCC; human leukemia cell lines Reh and RS4 were originally obtained from ATCC and generously provided by Dr. Terzah Horton Baylor College of Medicine. Cell line authentication was performed by PCR amplification of nine short tandem repeat (STR) loci (Research Animal Diagnostic Laboratory St. Louis MO) and comparing the profile to the ATCC STR database. The STR profile of MCF-7 and RS4 cell lines were identical to the ATCC profile. The Reh cell line matched all alleles in the ATCC Reh profile plus one extra allele at two loci. Cytotoxicity assays Human leukemia cell lines Reh or RS4 were plated in triplicate in 96-well microtiter plates in RPMI-1640 (with 25 mM HEPES) medium containing 10 fetal bovine serum at final densities of 8 104 cells well. MCF-7 cells were plated in the same medium at the final density of 1000cells well. Medium containing native thiaminase at a concentration range of 1 10?6 to 4 units ml was added to cells and incubated for four days. Following incubation an MTT Cell Proliferation Assay (ATCC) was performed according to the ATCC protocol. The IC50 was calculated from the dose response curve as the concentration of drug producing a 50 decrease in the mean absorbance compared to the untreated wells using Prism GraphPad software. The cytotoxicity experiments were repeated a minimum of three times in triplicate. Analysis of primary human ALL specimens was performed by plating cells at a density of 1 106 ml and treating for 24 hours with the indicated concentration of thiaminase. Viability was evaluated by dead cell exclusion labeling with trypan blue dye as well as flow cytometric analyses using Annexin-V labeling as previously described 9 . Xenograft studies RS4 tumor xenografts were established by subcutaneously inoculating 1 107 cells into the right flank of five-week-old female Crl:NU-Foxn1 nude mice (Charles River Laboratories Wilmington MA). For the establishment of MCF-7 xenograft a 17?-estradiol pellet (0.72 mg 60 days release; Innovative Research of America Sarasota FL) was implanted subcutaneously into the neck to facilitate optimal tumor growth for the estrogen receptor positive MCF-7 cells. The xenografts were initiated by subcutaneously injecting 5 106 MCF-7 cells into the right flank of five-week-old female Crl:NU-Foxn1 nude mice. When palpable tumors had formed mice were treated with native thiaminase at its MTD (2000 units kg body weight) twice a week at a site distant from the formed tumor for three weeks. Mice were treated with a single dose of thiaminase enzyme conjugated with 1k linear chain PEG (1K-LCPTE) at its MTD (50 U kg) at a site distant from the formed tumor. Mice treated with N3-pyridyl thiamine (N3PT) received an intraperitoneal (i.p.) dosage of 80 mg kg daily for five days. Mice treated with both 1K-LCPTE and N3PT received a single dose of 1K-LCPTE at 50 U kg first then after 5five days mice received N3PT at 80 mg kg daily for five days. Tumors were measured twice a week in a blinded manner by measuring perpendicular diameters with a digital caliper and tumor volumes (mm3) were calculated using the following formula: volume ? ? width width length ? 6. The predetermined endpoint was a tumor volume of 1500 mm3. The control mice were injected with MCF-7 or RS4 cells and left untreated and results combined with a previous control group of the same xenograft 7 . Kaplan-Meier survival curves and statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism software. Primary lymphoblastic leukemia xenograft methods A primary lymphoblastic leukemia specimen was transplanted by IV injection into sub-lethally irradiated immune deficient NOD SCID IL2Rg mice. When the tumor burden was established in the bone marrow (day 17) animals received treatment with thiaminase 2000 units kg on days 17 20 and 24 administered by subcutaneous injection (the longer interval between treatments in these mice in comparison to the Crl:NU-Foxn1 nude mice was due to tolerability). The animals were sacrificed on day 33 and marrow cells were isolated and examined by flow cytometry using human-specific antibodies for CD45 and CD19 to determine the level of human leukemia cell engraftment as previously described 9 . Mitochondrial bioenergetics measurements Oxygen consumption was determined using the Seahorse Extracellular Flux (XF-96) analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience Chicopee MA). The XF-96 measures the concentration of oxygen and free protons in the medium above a monolayer of cells in real-time. Thus the rates of oxygen consumption and proton production can be measured across several samples at a time. To allow comparison between experiments data are presented as oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in pMoles min 104 cells and the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) in mpH min 104 cells. RS4 and Reh leukemia cells were seeded at 125000 cells well into gelatin-coated Seahorse Bioscience XF microplates cultured in the presence or absence of 2 g L D-glucose and then centrifuged to adhere to the bottom of the wells while for the MCF-7 and MCF-10A about 45000 cells were plated and allowed to adhere overnight. OCR was measured four times and plotted as a function of cells under the basal condition followed by the sequential addition of oligomycin (1 µg ml) FCCP (1 µM) and rotonone (1 µM). The ATP-linked OCR was calculated as the basal OCR minus the OCR measured after the addition of oligomycin. The OCR maximal capacity was the direct rate measured after the addition of FCCP. The reserve capacity is the FCCP OCR minus the basal OCR. For the ECAR measurements cells were washed following overnight incubation and changed to assay media lacking glucose. Basal ECAR were measured four times and plotted as a function of cells under the basal condition followed by the sequential addition of glucose (25 mM) oligomycin (1 µg ml) and 2-deoxyglucose (25 mM). The rate of glycolysis was determined by subtracting the basal ECAR from the ECAR after the addition of glucose. Glycolytic reserve was determined by subtracting the ECAR following the addition of oligomycin from the ECAR following the addition of glucose. Differences between treatment groups were calculated using the Kruskal Wallis test. Metabolomic studies RS4 leukemia cells and MCF-7 breast cancer cells were analyzed under six conditions: control for 24 hrs (C-24); incubation in thiaminase for 24 hrs (T-24); control for 48 hours (C-48); thiaminase for 48 hrs (T-48); rapamycin for 48 hrs (R-48); and both rapamycin and thiaminase for 48 hrs (R T-48). Four independent samples were produced for each time point for each cell line and cell pellets were stored at ?80 C until the separate experiments were all completed. Metabolomic studies were performed at Metabolon Inc. (Durham NC). The non-targeted metabolic profiling platform consisted of three independent instrumental methods: ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC MS MS2) optimized for basic species; UHPLC MS MS2 optimized for acidic species; and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC MS). The detailed process of the platform; including sample processing instrument configuration data acquisition as well as metabolite identification and quantitation were published previously 10 11 . Three hundred and forty two metabolites were identified by automated comparison of the ion features in the experimental samples to a reference library of chemical standard entries that included retention time molecular weight (m z) preferred adducts in-source fragments and associated MS spectra 12 . Instrument variability was determined by calculating the median relative standard deviation (RSD) for the internal standards that were added to each sample prior to injection into the mass spectrometers. Overall process variability was determined by calculating the median RSD for all endogenous metabolites (i.e. non-instrument standards) present in 100 of a set of technical replicates of pooled samples. Values for instrument and process variability meet Metabolon s acceptance criteria with instrument variability of 3 and overall process variability of 12 . Following normalization to total protein (Bradford assay) log transformation and imputation with minimum observed values for each compound Welch s two-sample t-tests were used to identify biochemicals that differed significantly between experimental groups. The entire metabolomic data sets for RS4 and MCF-7 cells with statistical results are included in data tables (Table S1). Immunoblot analysis Cells were treated with thiaminase (0.001 U ml) and or rapamycin (0.1 µM) for 96 hours. Cells were lysed with a triple-detergent lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH8.0 150 mM NaCl 1 NP-40 0.5 DOC 0.1 SDS 0.02 sodium azide 100 µg ml PMSF protease inhibitors (Roche) and phosphatase inhibitors (Thermo Scientific)). Equal amounts of protein were loaded into each well and separated by SDS-PAGE gel followed by transfer onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked incubated with the indicated primary antibodies at 4 C overnight and the appropriate horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibody was added for 1 hour at room temperature. Immunoblots were developed by use of SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer s protocol and analyzed by FujiFilm LAS-4000 luminescent image analyzer (Multigauge software). The primary and secondary antibodies used in this study are listed as follows. Anti- PKM1; anti-BCAT2; anti-TPK1 and anti-THTPA antibodies were purchased from Proteintech Group Inc. (Chicago IL). Anti- PKM2 and anti-CPT1A antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers MA). Anti-BCKDE1 and anti-phospho-BCKDE1 antibodies were obtained from Bethyl laboratories (Montgomery TX). Anti-BCAT1 anti-?-actin and all secondary antibodies were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis MO). Results Evidence of antitumor activity of thiaminase in leukemia and breast cancer tumor models is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1A is a Kaplan-Meier plot of MCF-7 subcutaneous xenografts treated with thiaminase showing a prolongation in the time to endpoint (pre-defined tumor volume) (TTE) from 41 days in the mock treated cohort to 59 days in the treated cohort (p? ?0.03). In Figure 1B RS4 subcutaneous xenografts show an increase in median TTE from 16.5 days from the start of treatment to undefined TTE after 60 days (p 0.001). We have also previously shown evidence of thiaminase activity against MDA231 breast cancer 8 . In Figure 1C the activity of thiaminase is shown against primary human leukemia cells. The most sensitive primary leukemia specimens appear to be lymphoblastic specimens with MLL-gene re-arrangements. This was of interest as the RS4 cell line is also an MLL-rearranged cell line. Figure 1D shows flow cytometric analysis of bone marrow of a primary MLL-rearranged leukemia cell xenograft treated with thiaminase demonstrating a decrease in leukemia cell proportion after treatment. These studies along with previous studies 7 8 provided the rationale for performing further detailed examination of the metabolic effects of thiaminase in the breast cancer cell line MCF-7 and in the RS4 leukemia cell line. In addition for further points of comparison we included selected studies in two additional cell lines Reh leukemia cells another lymphoblastic leukemia cell line and MCF-10A a non-malignant breast cell line. 10.1371 journal.pone.0085702.g001 Figure 1 In vivo evidence of thiaminase anticancer activity.

{"system": "You are a medical text classifier. Choose exactly one label.", "user": "Text: The lung tissues were fixed in 10 neutral formalin embedded in paraffin and cut into 5 µm thick slices after we took photographs to record staining on the lung surface. We made 4 axial slices that covered the center of the staining. The slices were subjected to hematoxylin-eosin (H-E) stain to the evaluate lung parenchymal change. We evaluated the presence or absence of neutrophil infiltration vasculitis necrosis hemorrhage and foam cell in alveolus. The extent of each histopathologic finding was estimated using visual grading scores as 0 (no) 1 (focal) or 2 (diffuse). Localized parenchymal change ( 50 of total area) surrounded by normal lung was defined as focal. Extensive lung parenchymal change (?50 of total area) that replaced normal lung was defined as diffuse. An experienced pathologist with eight years of experience reviewed all slices. The overall severity of the lung parenchymal change was defined as a total score by adding visual grading scores for each histopathologic finding. We compared the overall severity score between MLM and methylene blue as well as between Group A and Group B. Statistical analysis All data are expressed as mean standard deviation (SD) unless otherwise stated. Comparisons of the average scores were performed by two-tailed unpaired Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney test. We used a Fisher's exact test to compare the number of subjects in the subgroups. Linear by linear association evaluated the association of the extent of lung parenchymal change and materials or groups. Null hypotheses of no difference were rejected if the P values were less than 0.05. The statistical analysis was performed with commercially available statistical software IBM SPSS Statistics version 20.0 (IBM Corp. in Armonk NY USA). RESULTS Subject characteristics procedural records time interval of injection and examinations Among the 24 subjects included in our study successful CT-guided percutaneous injections into the desired location of the lung were achieved in 21 subjects (11 in Group A and 10 in Group B). Three subjects died during anesthesia. Mean weight was 3.2 0.2 kg for Group A and 3.3 0.2 kg for Group B. Injection depth from visceral pleura to needle tip was 0.4 0.1 cm (range: 0.3-0.6 cm) for MLM and 0.4 0.1 cm (range: 0.3-0.7 cm) for methylene blue (P 0.43). Distance from skin to needle tip was 2.8 0.6 cm (range: 2.1-5.0 cm) for MLM and 2.8 0.3 cm (range: 2.2-3.5 cm) for methylene blue (P 0.83). Of 42 CT-guided percutaneous injections total number of procedure related complications was 10 (24 ) including 7 leakage (all in MLM) and 3 pneumothorax (2 in MLM 1 in methylene blue). The complication rate in MLM was significantly higher than methylene blue (43 vs 5 ) (P 0.004). On post-procedural CT images the extent of the radio-opacity of MLM was 1.3 0.4 cm (range: 0.7-2.0 cm) for Group A and 0.6 0.3 cm (range: 0.3-1.1 cm) for Group B. Discrete compact nodular opacity was achieved in 15 subjects (72 ) scattered nodular opacities in 3 (14 ) and small faint opacity in 3 (14 ) (Fig. 4). The average value of radio-opacity of MLM was 1415 856 HU (range: 307-2768 HU). The interval between injection and sacrifice was 7.9 0.1 hr (range: 7.8-8.0 hr) for Group A and 23.5 0.1 hr (range: 23.4-23.7 hr) for Group B. Time from injection to initial and follow up fluoroscopy was 3.4 0.5 hr (range: 2.5-4.2 hr) and 6.8 0.4 hr (range: 6.3-7.7 hr) for Group A and 1.5 0.4 hr (range: 0.9-2.1 hr) and 22.6 0.4 hr (range: 21.9-23.2 hr) for Group B respectively. Scores and extent of staining and radio-opacity demonstrates the staining extent and localization ability of MLM and methylene blue. In total groups the staining extent of MLM was significant smaller than methylene blue (0.6 cm vs 1.0 cm P 0.001). MLM showed a significantly higher staining ability score than methylene blue (2.8 vs 2.2 P 0.010). Radio-opacity in the initial fluoroscopy was not significantly different from the follow up (2.0 vs 1.9 P 0.49). showed the number of subjects in each score of localization ability of staining or radio-opacity. In Group A appropriate staining was 100 for both MLM and methylene blue. In Group B appropriate staining was 90 for MLM and 70 for methylene blue. Appropriate staining of MLM was not significantly different from that of methylene blue (95 vs 86 P 0.61); however excellent staining in MLM was significantly higher than methylene blue (81 vs 38 P 0.011) (). shows the localization ability of MLM regarding both staining ability and radio-opacity. There was no subject with a score of 0 or 1 in both radio-opacity and staining. MLM achieved appropriate staining or radio-opacity in 21 subjects (100 ) with a dual localization feature. Histopathologic findings demonstrates the results of the histopathologic findings. In all lung specimens both methylene blue and MLM showed acute lung parenchymal change that included neutrophil infiltration hemorrhage and foam cell in alveolus (Fig. 4). Comparing the two materials the number of specimen having neutrophil infiltration vasculitis necrosis hemorrhage and foam cell in alveolus was similar in each extent. In terms of all features the number of specimen that showed diffuse extent was more in Group B than Group A for both MLM and methylene blue. The extent of the histopathologic findings was not significantly associated with the materials for all histopathologic features (). Among the histopathologic findings the extent of vasculitis was significantly associated with Group for both MLM and methylene blue (P 0.002 for both MLM and methylene blue). Focal or diffuse extent of vasculitis was more frequently found in Group A than Group B (P 0.001 for both MLM and methylene blue). The overall severity of lung parenchymal change was not different between MLM and methylene blue (5.6 1.6 vs 5.7 1.5 P 0.839); in addition Group B showed a significantly higher overall severity score of lung parenchymal change than Group A (6.6 1.6 vs 4.7 0.9 P 0.005). DISCUSSION The results of this study show that MLM is a useful percutaneous injection material for a successful localization in the lung. The average staining score of MLM was significantly higher than methylene blue (2.8 0.5 vs 2.2 0.7 P 0.010). In terms of staining the appropriate localization rate (acceptable or excellent staining) in our study was 95 using MLM. The result was in close agreement with previous studies that showed a high success performance rate of lipiodol localization (99 -100 ) (21-23). An appropriate localization rate (acceptable or excellent staining) of methylene blue injection was 86 in our study. This is lower than the results found in previous studies where the success rate of methylene blue injection was 96 -100 (18 20). We found that an acceptable (or excellent staining rate) of MLM and methylene blue was not significantly different (95 vs 86 P 0.610). However MLM showed excellent staining for localization in 17 (81 ) of 21 subjects and was significantly higher than methylene blue (38 ) (P 0.011). The results indicate that lipiodol reduced the spread of methylene blue. This is the first study to indicate that MLM is an available percutaneous injection material for localization with superior staining ability compared to methylene blue. The complication rate was 43 in MLM and 5 in the methylene blue (P 0.004). Possible complications after percutaneous injection for pulmonary localization include pneumothorax leakage hemorrhage pain hemoptysis hemothorax and embolism. Previous studies reported that the complication rate was 17-29 for lipiodol and 33 for methylene blue (2023 24). The complication rate of MLM in the current study was higher than the results of previous studies mainly due to the leakage of MLM into the pleural cavity (n 9). This difference was probably because the distance from the pleura to the injecting needle tip (0.4 0.1 cm for MLM) was inadequate to avoid leakage into the pleural cavity. In the previous studies of lipiodol marking for localization the mean distance from the pleura to the target nodule was 1.0-1.9 cm (22-24) more than twice our study. The results indicate that the high complication rate of our study is associated with the inserting procedure of the needle rather than MLM itself. The dispersion of methylene blue throughout the lung parenchyma may lead to unnecessarily large wedge resections; in addition some have reported instances of the dispersion of methylene blue throughout the entire pleural surface or intraoperative identification failure due to severe anthracosis of the visceral pleura. The failure rate was reported to be 0 -13 with the use of methylene blue (1819 25). The results are similar to our study and indicate that inappropriate staining on the lung surface was 14 in methylene blue. In this study we found that the dispersion of methylene blue in MLM through the lung parenchyma was significantly smaller than methylene blue (0.6 0.3 cm vs 1.0 0.4 cm P 0.05). The result implies that lipiodol reduces the spread of methylene blue in lung parenchyma. Regarding the score of radio-opacity 38 of MLM showed non-visualization or minimally increased opacity on the fluoroscopic examinations. It means the proportion of lipiodol in MLM at the time of the percutaneous injection was too small to be detected. Post-procedural CT images also revealed that 3 subjects had small faint radio-opacity after the injection of MLM. It suggests that the uneven blending of lipiodol and methylene blue occurred during the preparation of MLM. Water-insolubility of lipiodol would result in the uneven mixing of water soluble methylene blue after mechanical blending of the two materials. Further research is required to reduce non-homogeneity of MLM at the time of injection. Previous studies reported the availability of a mixture of methylene blue with other materials such as collagen or autologous blood (15 16). They performed VATS resection on the same day as localization. In our study we evaluated the localization ability of MLM on the same day of localization (6 hr) as well as 24 hr after injection. Localization is usually performed on the day of surgery. This requires the simultaneous use of the CT and the operating room which is not always available. Surgeries on the next day of localization were reported in several published articles (26 27). MLM shows a prolonged localization ability of up to 24 hr in terms of staining ability and radio-opacity. Stable localization ability is the advantage of MLM in our study. Due to uneven blending of MLM one subject (10 ) showed inappropriate staining and appropriate radio-opacity and required an intraoperative fluoroscopic examination to detect MLM. Possible radiation exposure is a drawback of MLM. We would like to justify the use of intraoperative fluoroscopy because the operator can avoid radiation exposure with a lead apron. In regards to the risk-benefit for patients lowering the risk of detection failure is thought to be more important than radiation exposure. Histopathologic examinations showed lung parenchymal changes in all specimens. Both methylene blue and MLM induced acute lung injury that included neutrophil infiltration vasculitis necrosis hemorrhage and foam cell in alveolus (). The results of our study are similar to those of a previous study by Kwon et al. (28) that showed that lipiodol led to acute lung injury. They described that lipiodol creates the histopathologic feature of acute lung injury such as peripheral endothelial cell damage neutrophil infiltration necrosis hemorrhage alveolar wall destruction vasculitis emboli (or thrombi in arteriole) and macrophages in the alveolar space (28). In our results the extent of lung parenchymal change was not associated with the materials for all histopathologic features. In addition the overall severity score of lung parenchymal change in MLM was not different from methylene blue (5.6 and 5.7 P 0.839). This suggests that MLM shows similar histopathologic effects in the lung parenchyma to methylene blue. The overall severity score of parenchymal change was higher in Group B (follow up interval of 24 hr) than Group A (follow up interval of 6 hr) (6.6 vs 4.7 P 0.005). The extent of lung parenchymal change depends on the time interval. Acute lung injury after the percutaneous injection of lipiodol or methylene blue was reported in animal studies (28 29); however there are no clinical results that show the adverse effect of acute lung injury in human lungs. Injection material (such as barium) can potentially complicate the pathologic diagnosis of the target lesion due to acute inflammation (29 30). To our knowledge no study has indicated that lipiodol or methylene blue hinders the histopathologic diagnosis of target lesions in human lungs. The small amount of material injection in human lungs might not create a significant parenchymal change or disrupt underlying lung disease. It is necessary to avoid directly injecting materials into the target lesion in human lungs in order to avoid the adverse effect of injection materials on underlying lung disease (especially ground glass opacity nodule or potential benign lesion). There were several limitations in our study. First we included only a small number of subjects. Second the overall localization success rate was low and the complication rate was high (compared to the results of previous studies) due to the difficulty in an accurate percutaneous injection at the desired location and depth in the small sized rabbit lung. Third we used a 1 mL syringe with manual administration to inject materials in the lung parenchyma and there were possible individual difference in the administering volume of materials. Fourth we could not evaluate complications such as intractable pain material related anaphylaxis or embolism. Fifth we could not evaluate if the histopathologic changes had any effect on underlying lung disease because the lung parenchyma of the experimental rabbits were normal. Finally we did not evaluate a successful localization for the true target lesion in lung parenchyma. The criteria for appropriate staining and radio-opacity were subjective. We expect that further clinical studies might provide an answer to if MLM can be a useful percutaneous injection material for localization in the human lung. In conclusion MLM is available for percutaneous injection for the pulmonary localization. The results of this study showed that MLM provides superior ability for appropriate localization than that of methylene blue.

{"system": "You are a medical text classifier. Choose exactly one label.", "user": "Text: 1.3 0.4 cm (range: 0.7-2.0 cm) for Group A and 0.6 0.3 cm (range: 0.3-1.1 cm) for Group B. Discrete compact nodular opacity was achieved in 15 subjects (72 ) scattered nodular opacities in 3 (14 ) and small faint opacity in 3 (14 ) (Fig. 4). The average value of radio-opacity of MLM was 1415 856 HU (range: 307-2768 HU). The interval between injection and sacrifice was 7.9 0.1 hr (range: 7.8-8.0 hr) for Group A and 23.5 0.1 hr (range: 23.4-23.7 hr) for Group B. Time from injection to initial and follow up fluoroscopy was 3.4 0.5 hr (range: 2.5-4.2 hr) and 6.8 0.4 hr (range: 6.3-7.7 hr) for Group A and 1.5 0.4 hr (range: 0.9-2.1 hr) and 22.6 0.4 hr (range: 21.9-23.2 hr) for Group B respectively. Scores and extent of staining and radio-opacity demonstrates the staining extent and localization ability of MLM and methylene blue. In total groups the staining extent of MLM was significant smaller than methylene blue (0.6 cm vs 1.0 cm P 0.001). MLM showed a significantly higher staining ability score than methylene blue (2.8 vs 2.2 P 0.010). Radio-opacity in the initial fluoroscopy was not significantly different from the follow up (2.0 vs 1.9 P 0.49). showed the number of subjects in each score of localization ability of staining or radio-opacity. In Group A appropriate staining was 100 for both MLM and methylene blue. In Group B appropriate staining was 90 for MLM and 70 for methylene blue. Appropriate staining of MLM was not significantly different from that of methylene blue (95 vs 86 P 0.61); however excellent staining in MLM was significantly higher than methylene blue (81 vs 38 P 0.011) (). shows the localization ability of MLM regarding both staining ability and radio-opacity. There was no subject with a score of 0 or 1 in both radio-opacity and staining. MLM achieved appropriate staining or radio-opacity in 21 subjects (100 ) with a dual localization feature. Histopathologic findings demonstrates the results of the histopathologic findings. In all lung specimens both methylene blue and MLM showed acute lung parenchymal change that included neutrophil infiltration hemorrhage and foam cell in alveolus (Fig. 4). Comparing the two materials the number of specimen having neutrophil infiltration vasculitis necrosis hemorrhage and foam cell in alveolus was similar in each extent. In terms of all features the number of specimen that showed diffuse extent was more in Group B than Group A for both MLM and methylene blue. The extent of the histopathologic findings was not significantly associated with the materials for all histopathologic features (). Among the histopathologic findings the extent of vasculitis was significantly associated with Group for both MLM and methylene blue (P 0.002 for both MLM and methylene blue). Focal or diffuse extent of vasculitis was more frequently found in Group A than Group B (P 0.001 for both MLM and methylene blue). The overall severity of lung parenchymal change was not different between MLM and methylene blue (5.6 1.6 vs 5.7 1.5 P 0.839); in addition Group B showed a significantly higher overall severity score of lung parenchymal change than Group A (6.6 1.6 vs 4.7 0.9 P 0.005). DISCUSSION The results of this study show that MLM is a useful percutaneous injection material for a successful localization in the lung. The average staining score of MLM was significantly higher than methylene blue (2.8 0.5 vs 2.2 0.7 P 0.010). In terms of staining the appropriate localization rate (acceptable or excellent staining) in our study was 95 using MLM. The result was in close agreement with previous studies that showed a high success performance rate of lipiodol localization (99 -100 ) (21-23). An appropriate localization rate (acceptable or excellent staining) of methylene blue injection was 86 in our study. This is lower than the results found in previous studies where the success rate of methylene blue injection was 96 -100 (18 20). We found that an acceptable (or excellent staining rate) of MLM and methylene blue was not significantly different (95 vs 86 P 0.610). However MLM showed excellent staining for localization in 17 (81 ) of 21 subjects and was significantly higher than methylene blue (38 ) (P 0.011). The results indicate that lipiodol reduced the spread of methylene blue. This is the first study to indicate that MLM is an available percutaneous injection material for localization with superior staining ability compared to methylene blue. The complication rate was 43 in MLM and 5 in the methylene blue (P 0.004). Possible complications after percutaneous injection for pulmonary localization include pneumothorax leakage hemorrhage pain hemoptysis hemothorax and embolism. Previous studies reported that the complication rate was 17-29 for lipiodol and 33 for methylene blue (2023 24). The complication rate of MLM in the current study was higher than the results of previous studies mainly due to the leakage of MLM into the pleural cavity (n 9). This difference was probably because the distance from the pleura to the injecting needle tip (0.4 0.1 cm for MLM) was inadequate to avoid leakage into the pleural cavity. In the previous studies of lipiodol marking for localization the mean distance from the pleura to the target nodule was 1.0-1.9 cm (22-24) more than twice our study. The results indicate that the high complication rate of our study is associated with the inserting procedure of the needle rather than MLM itself. The dispersion of methylene blue throughout the lung parenchyma may lead to unnecessarily large wedge resections; in addition some have reported instances of the dispersion of methylene blue throughout the entire pleural surface or intraoperative identification failure due to severe anthracosis of the visceral pleura. The failure rate was reported to be 0 -13 with the use of methylene blue (1819 25). The results are similar to our study and indicate that inappropriate staining on the lung surface was 14 in methylene blue. In this study we found that the dispersion of methylene blue in MLM through the lung parenchyma was significantly smaller than methylene blue (0.6 0.3 cm vs 1.0 0.4 cm P 0.05). The result implies that lipiodol reduces the spread of methylene blue in lung parenchyma. Regarding the score of radio-opacity 38 of MLM showed non-visualization or minimally increased opacity on the fluoroscopic examinations. It means the proportion of lipiodol in MLM at the time of the percutaneous injection was too small to be detected. Post-procedural CT images also revealed that 3 subjects had small faint radio-opacity after the injection of MLM. It suggests that the uneven blending of lipiodol and methylene blue occurred during the preparation of MLM. Water-insolubility of lipiodol would result in the uneven mixing of water soluble methylene blue after mechanical blending of the two materials. Further research is required to reduce non-homogeneity of MLM at the time of injection. Previous studies reported the availability of a mixture of methylene blue with other materials such as collagen or autologous blood (15 16). They performed VATS resection on the same day as localization. In our study we evaluated the localization ability of MLM on the same day of localization (6 hr) as well as 24 hr after injection. Localization is usually performed on the day of surgery. This requires the simultaneous use of the CT and the operating room which is not always available. Surgeries on the next day of localization were reported in several published s (26 27). MLM shows a prolonged localization ability of up to 24 hr in terms of staining ability and radio-opacity. Stable localization ability is the advantage of MLM in our study. Due to uneven blending of MLM one subject (10 ) showed inappropriate staining and appropriate radio-opacity and required an intraoperative fluoroscopic examination to detect MLM. Possible radiation exposure is a drawback of MLM. We would like to justify the use of intraoperative fluoroscopy because the operator can avoid radiation exposure with a lead apron. In regards to the risk-benefit for patients lowering the risk of detection failure is thought to be more important than radiation exposure. Histopathologic examinations showed lung parenchymal changes in all specimens. Both methylene blue and MLM induced acute lung injury that included neutrophil infiltration vasculitis necrosis hemorrhage and foam cell in alveolus (). The results of our study are similar to those of a previous study by Kwon et al. (28) that showed that lipiodol led to acute lung injury. They described that lipiodol creates the histopathologic feature of acute lung injury such as peripheral endothelial cell damage neutrophil infiltration necrosis hemorrhage alveolar wall destruction vasculitis emboli (or thrombi in arteriole) and macrophages in the alveolar space (28). In our results the extent of lung parenchymal change was not associated with the materials for all histopathologic features. In addition the overall severity score of lung parenchymal change in MLM was not different from methylene blue (5.6 and 5.7 P 0.839). This suggests that MLM shows similar histopathologic effects in the lung parenchyma to methylene blue. The overall severity score of parenchymal change was higher in Group B (follow up interval of 24 hr) than Group A (follow up interval of 6 hr) (6.6 vs 4.7 P 0.005).\nLabels: [Thyroid_Cancer, Colon_Cancer, Lung_Cancer]\nReply with one label only.", "assistant": "Lung_Cancer"}

protease serine type2 tmprss2 belonging to the type ii transmembrane serine protease family could cleave the coronavirus spike s protein it was demonstrated that ace2 and tmprss2 were crucial for the entry of sarscov and sarscov2 into the host cells cell entry of sarscov2 depends on binding of the s protein to the specific cellular receptor and s protein priming by host cell proteases as shown in fig each s protein of sarscov2 consists of two subunits a globular s1 domain at the nterminal region and the membraneproximal s2 domain sarscov2 utilizes receptorbinding domain within the s1 domain to bind to the cellular receptor ace2 which could trigger the effects of tmprss2 on the cleavage of protein s at the s1 and s2 sites and priming cell membrane fusion for viral entry as receptors and mediators of virus entry are important for determining viral host and an the route of sarscov2 infection and the infected an may depend on the expression and distribution of ace2 and tmprss2 studies have shown that ace2 and tmprss2 are expressed not only in lung tissues but also in extrapulmonary ans including heart kidney liver colon esophagus brain gallbladder and testis suggesting that sarscov2 may also affect extrapulmonary ans in this review the distributions of ace2 and tmprss2 in extrapulmonary ans and the characteristics and clinical managements of extrapulmonary an injury

extrapulmonary ans the mrna expressions of ace2 in different human ans were analyzed and the results showed that ace2 was expressed in the heart furthermore chen analyzed the feature of ace2 expressions among cardiac cell types and found that ace2 was specifically expressed in pericyte moreover rna sequencing from patients with failing hearts and normal donors revealed that myocardial ace2 expressions were significantly increased in patients with heart failure which was further validated at the protein level by proteomics profiling from heart failure and normal donors another study also showed that the expression of ace2 in heart tissues of patients with underlying heart disease was higher than that in normal heart tissues these two studies suggested that the expression of ace2

while it was not observed in immune cells and glomerular parietal epithelial cells rna and protein expression data of ace2 in different human tissues and cancer cell lines were obtained from three online datasets including the cancer cell line encyclopedia ccle gtex database and the human protein atlas dataset and the results indicated that both mrna and protein expression levels of ace2 were relatively high in kidney cells especially in renal tubular cells meanwhile suryawanshi analyzed the data of kidney tissues in scrnaseq datasets and found that either proximal tubular cells or tubular

epithelial cells endothelial cells and mesangial cells of the kidney recently pan also found that the tmprss2 gene was coexpressed with ace2 in kidney podocytes these data showed that both ace2 and tmprss2 were highly expressed in tissues and cells of kidney liver chai et al analyzed the scrnaseq data from geo database gse124395 to evaluate ace2 gene expression in liver the results showed that ace2 was highly expressed in cholangiocytes which level was about times higher than that in hepatocytes the gtex database also showed that both ace2 and tmprss2 were expressed in the liver zhou

cytoplasm of gastrointestinal epithelial cells besides the scrnaseq data showed that ace2 was significantly elevated in the proximal and distal enterocytes guo et al suggested that tmprss2 was highly expressed in almost all ans of the digestive tract including colon stomach small intestine and esophagus using published scrnaseq data and seven inhouse normal colon samples lee reported that the coexpressions of ace2 and tmprss2 transcripts were mainly observed in the small intestine and colon the highest expressions of tmprss2 and ace2 were found in enterocytes among the intestinal cell

china moreover ace2 and tmprss2 were also reported to be coexpressed in some other ans it has been revealed that both ace2 and tmprss2 are expressed in testis by scrna sequencing and expression profile analysis indicating that testicular cells might be the potential targets of sarscov2 another report revealed that multiple kinds of cells in the nose including nasal brushing epithelial cells nasal turbinate epithelial cells and nasal airway epithelial cells contained ace2expressed and tmprss2expressed cell clusters moreover ace2 and tmprss2 were also expressed in pancreas breast prostate and thyroid and these ans might also be the targets of sarscov2 infection of sarscov2 and extrapulmonary an injury of patients with covid19 sarscov2 infection and cardiac injury recently autopsy analysis by fox revealed that the histopathology of the heart was consistent with the typical pattern of viral myocarditis sarscov2 rna was detected in the cardiac tissues of the patients with covid19 these data suggested that sarscov2 may directly infect heart the epidemiology of covid19 reported that cardiac injury was one of the most severe an damages the clinical manifestations of cardiac injury in covid19 patients are complex and could present with heart failure arrhythmias or acute myocardial infarction ami inciardi reported the first case who had the symptom of heart failure at first and later the patient was positive for sarscov2 using nucleic acid test cardiac injury is a common symptom in patients with covid19 shi reported that patients with covid19 had cardiac injury moreover there were patients with acute cardiac injury in a cohort including covid19 patients and of patients with acute cardiac injury in the intensive care unit icu furthermore a study by wang showed that there were patients with acute cardiac injury and patients presented with arrhythmia of covid19 patients while acute cardiac injury was observed in of patients with civid19 in the icu these cases suggested that sarscov2 may cause serious heart damage which should be widespreadly concerned furthermore acute cardiac injury is more prevalent in severe cases with covid19 table and it has been reported that covid19 patients with cardiac injury had higher mortality than those without cardiac injury in this review we also summarized the possible relationship between basic heart disease and further cardiac injury table in a cohort of covid19 patients from renmin hospital of wuhan university china shi demonstrated that cardiac injury occurred in patients during hospitalization of which had basic heart disease including coronary heart disease and chronic heart failure and only patients with basic heart disease of covid19 patients without cardiac injury similarly liu

cardiovascular diseases of covid19 patients without cardiac injury other studies also indicated that the patients with basic cardiovascular disease are more likely to present heat injury in covid19 patients in view of the points above covid19 patients with underlying cardiac conditions seem to have higher rates of cardiac injury sarscov2 infection and kidney injury recently autopsy analysis on six covid19 patients showed that varying degrees of acute tubular necrosis were observed in all the renal specimens nucleoprotein np antigens and np positive inclusion body of sarscov2 could be seen in kidney tissues from all the samples moreover viruslike ps were seen in kidney tissues by transmission electronic microscope tem su analyzed kidney abnormalities in autopsies of patients with covid19 and found that diffuse proximal tubular damage with the loss of brush border were biomedicinepharmacotherapy13120201106784 0c sarscov2 infection and liver injury m dong observed further investigation showed that diffuse necrosis can be seen under the light microscope and electron microscopic examination also showed the clusters of coronavirus ps with distinctive spikes in the tubular epithelium and podocytes it was reported that both np antigens and rna of sarscov2 were detected in urine of covid19 patients these data coincide with the finding of the sarscov2 invasion in kidney collectively sarscov2 could directly infect human renal tubules and lead to kidney damage recent studies have shown that the incidence of acute kidney injury aki in covid19 patients ranged from and higher frequency of renal function damage with elevated blood urea nitrogen bun or serum creatinine scr was observed in covid19 patients table a study of patients with covid19 indicated that levels of bun and scr were increased in and patients with covid19 respectively and routine urine tests were performed on patients among which patients were positive for urinary protein and patients were positive for hematuria another study also showed that about patients with covid19 had abnormal renal function moreover covid19 patients with more severe disease progression have higher rates of aki huang and colleagues reported that of patients with aki in the icu were observed and none of the patients who did not require care in the icu suffered aki xu found that the fatality rate was obviously higher in covid19 patients with aki than those without renal injury furthermore in another study investigating patients with covid19 at hospital admission more severe patients had higher rates of aki and the cox regression analysis also suggested that covid19 patients who developed aki had a significantly higher mortality risk therefore aki is more prevalent in severe cases with covid19 an autopsy report of a 50yearold patient with covid19 showed moderate microvesicular steatosis and mild lobular activity in liver tissues moreover zhao used human liver ductal anoids as a tool to investigate the sarscov2 infection and the tissue damage induced by sarscov2 ex vivo and the results showed that the expression of sarscov2 np was easily detected in the patchy areas of the hepatic duct indicating that liver ductal anoids were susceptible to sarscov2 infection in addition sarscov2 infection could disrupt the barrier and bile acid transporting functions of cholangiocytes which indicated that sarscov2 might directly induce cholangiocyte injury and consequently bile acid accumulation in view of the points above liver damage in the covid19 patients might be directly caused by the viral infection abnormal liver functions were frequently reported in covid19 patients epidemiologic studies showed that almost half of the patients had differing degrees of liver damage table chen reported that out of patients had elevated alanine aminotransferase alt patients had elevated aspartate aminotransferase ast and had elevated total bilirubin tbil in wuhan jinyintan hospital wuhan china similarly a nationwide study involving patients with covid19 in china showed that more than of patients had elevated alt and ast and of patients had elevated tbil it was revealed that the levels of direct bilirubin indirect bilirubin alt alkaline phosphatase alp and gammaglutamyltransferase ggt were significantly higher in males than that in females with covid19 and multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that male was an important independent risk factor for predicting acute liver injury ali in covid19 patients these data indicated that male patients with covid19 may be more

Choose exactly one label.", "user": "Text: the pharmacological manipulation of Hsp70 levels in cancer cells may be an effective means of preventing the progression of tumours. We found that the downregulation of Hsp70 by ibuprofen in vitro enhances the antitumoural activity of cisplatin in lung cancer. Ibuprofen prominently suppressed the expression of Hsp70 in A549 cells derived from lung adenocarcinoma and sensitized them to cisplatin in association with an increase in the mitochondrial apoptotic cascade whereas ibuprofen alone did not induce cell death. The cisplatin-dependent events occurring up- and downstream of mitochondrial disruption were accelerated by treatment with ibuprofen. The increase in cisplatin-induced apoptosis caused by the depletion of Hsp70 by RNA interference is evidence that the increased apoptosis by ibuprofen is mediated by its effect on Hsp70. Our observations indicate that the suppression of Hsp70 by ibuprofen mediates the sensitivity to cisplatin by enhancing apoptosis at several stages of the mitochondrial cascade. Ibuprofen therefore is a potential therapeutic agent that might allow lowering the doses of cisplatin and limiting the many challenge associated with its toxicity and development of drug resistance. Hsp70 apoptosis ibuprofen The human Hsp70 family includes ?8 highly homologous members that differ from each other by their intracellular localization and expression patterns.1 Among them the major stress-inducible Hsp70 (also called Hsp72) has an essential role in cell survival under stressful conditions. Compared with its normal counterpart Hsp70 is often overexpressed in various cancer cells and is suspected to contribute to the development of tumours.2 3 Indeed the expression of Hsp70 in certain cancer types has been correlated with poor prognosis and resistance to chemotherapy.45 6 Tumour cells often express several proteins that when abnormally elevated render the tumour resistant to apoptosis.7 Previous studies have confirmed not only that Hsp70 is cytoprotective but also that it interferes effectively with cell death induced by a wide variety of stimuli including several cancer-related stresses. Hsp70 is a potent inhibitor of the stress-activated kinase pathway and apparently blocks apoptotic signals via interactions with JNK Ask1 and SEK1.8910 11 Hsp70 is also a negative regulator of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. Much of the focus on the antiapoptotic function of Hsp70 has been on events that occur after the disruption of the mitochondria. Hsp70 prevents the recruitment of procaspase-9 to the apoptosome and its functional complex formation by direct interaction with apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 (Apaf-1).12 13 Furthermore Hsp70 inhibits the activation of caspase-3 and the cleavage of caspase-3 targets such as ICAD and GATA-1.14 15 On the other hand recent studies have reported that Hsp70 can prevent apoptosis upstream of the mitochondria by inhibiting events which ultimately permeabilize the mitochondrial outer membrane such as the activation of Bax.16 17 As a result of the inhibition by Hsp70 of the apoptosis induced by several anticancer drugs as well as by other stimuli we hypothesized that cancer cells would be sensitized to the induction of apoptosis by the neutralization of Hsp70. Hsp70 has been indeed targeted with pharmaceuticals such as triptolide quercetin and KNK437 which downregulate its expression.1819 20 Although they have prevented the progression of various cancer cells in vitro and in vivo21 22 the optimal clinical use of these small Hsp70 inhibitors singly or combined with other chemotherapeutics remains a challenge. Our overall objective was to pharmacologically control the levels of Hsp70 and increase the effectiveness of anticancer drugs. Several experimental and epidemiologic studies and clinical trials have observed a powerful chemopreventive activity exerted by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).23 24 The anti-carcinogenic properties of NSAID have been attributed to their inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes. However much higher doses of NSAID are needed to obtain an antitumoural effect than to inhibit COX25 suggesting that they also act via COX-independent mechanisms. On the other hand NSAIDs such as aspirin salicylate and sulindac sulphide inhibit the proliferation of cells and induce apoptosis in various cancer cell lines which is considered an important component of their antitumoural activity and increased sensitization of cancer cells to anticancer drugs.262728 29 There is currently interest in the ability of NSAID to directly lower the levels of antiapoptotic molecules such as the Bcl-2 family30 and 14-3-3 protein31 which inhibits the intrinsic mitochondria-dependent apoptosis in various cancer cells. Therefore the NSAID-induced dysfunction of antiapoptotic proteins prompted us to examine whether other antiapoptotic molecules including Hsp70 might also be targets in the prevention of tumour progression by NSAID. In this study we show that ibuprofen is a potent inhibitor of Hsp70 which significantly suppresses its expression by depleting heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) in lung adenocarcinoma-derived A549 cells. The downregulation of Hsp70 by ibuprofen sensitized the cells to cisplatin which was associated with the enhancement of cisplatin-induced apoptotic signalling. Ibuprofen did not only facilitate postmitochondrial events including the activation of cisplatin-induced caspase-9 but also the activation of Bax causing the release of cytochrome c. Besides the demonstration of a similar increase in the sensitivity of A549 cells to cisplatin conferred by Hsp70 knockdown and ibuprofen these observations indicate that ibuprofen accelerates cisplatin-mediated apoptosis at multiple steps of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway via the inhibition of Hsp70. We conclude that ibuprofen is a potential chemotherapeutic agent which might enable (a) the use of lower less toxic does of cisplatin and (b) the design of a new combination treatment of lung cancer. Results Ibuprofen suppresses the expression of Hsp70 in lung adenocarcinoma cells To define the role of Hsp70 in promoting the formation of tumours we first examined its expression in human lung cancer cell lines. Compared with BEAS-2B a human non-malignant bronchial epithelial cell line the expression levels of Hsp70 in lung cancer cells such as A549 and H358 adenocarcinoma were notably higher (a). As in previous studies which showed an increased expression of Hsp70 in various types of human cancers including breast pancreas and colon we found that Hsp70 is also dysregulated in lung cancer cells. In this study we screened conventional NSAID in search of a new pharmacologic inhibitor which neutralizes Hsp70 as they induce apoptosis in cancer cells by selectively downregulating antiapoptotic proteins. The expression of Hsp70 after the exposure of A549 cells to various NSAID in non-toxic concentrations was analyzed by immunoblot. Ibuprofen in a 400-?M concentration decreased the expression of Hsp70 by 23 in comparison with untreated cells whereas other NSAID had no effect (). b shows the decrease in Hsp70 protein and mRNA levels in A549 cells after treatment with various concentrations of ibuprofen versus no apparent decreases in Hsc70 and Actin. Ibuprofen also decreased the expression of Hsp70 in H358 a human lung adenocarcinoma cell line in a dose-dependent manner (c). These results suggest that ibuprofen decreases the expression of Hsp70 in various lung cancer cell lines. Ibuprofen enhances the apoptosis induced by cisplatin by suppressing Hsp70 As ibuprofen prominently inhibited the expression of Hsp70 we next examined its effect on the proliferation of cancer cells. We observed no significant change in the viability of A549 and H358 cells after the exposure to ?800??M concentrations of ibuprofen alone which downregulates Hsp70 (a) while the exposure to 1.0?mM concentration of ibuprofen caused cell death. Combined these observations indicate that the downregulation of stress-inducible Hsp70 was insufficient to cause the death of A549 and H358 cells. There is evidence that the inhibition of anti-apoptotic molecules such as Hsp70 increases the sensitivity of tumour cells to anticancer drugs thus improving the outcomes of chemotherapy. To study the therapeutic potential of ibuprofen we examined whether its antitumoural effects are synergistic with those of cisplatin widely used in the treatment of lung adenocarcinoma. When we measured the survival of A549 (top of b) and H358 (bottom of b) cells exposed to increasing concentrations of cisplatin incubated in presence versus absence of ibuprofen the latter prominently magnified the apoptosis induced by cisplatin a synergistic effect confirmed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick and labelling (TUNEL) staining (c). To ascertain the effects conferred by the expression of Hsp70 on cell death while excluding all effects of ibuprofen unrelated to Hsp70 we weakened the expression of Hsp70 by RNA interference (RNAi) (d) and measured its effects on the apoptosis induced by cisplatin. The inhibition of Hsp70 decreased the viability of cisplatin-treated cells by approximately 20 (e). Transfections with scrambled siRNA serving as a control showed no increase in cell death mediated by cisplatin. Cisplatin had no effect on the expression of Hsp70 (g). We quantified the number of apoptotic cells in ibuprofen- and or cisplatin-treated cultures using the CF488A-annexin V methods. Although cisplatin alone induced apoptosis in 10.2 of A549 cells the co-treatment with ibuprofen increased the percentage of apoptotic cells to 34.0 (f). These observations suggest that ibuprofen sensitizes A549 cells to cisplatin by decreasing the expression of Hsp70. Ibuprofen decreases the expression of Hsp70 via transcriptional inactivation The reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis described earlier revealed a decrease in RNA level following treatment with ibuprofen suggesting that the expression of Hsp70 can be downregulated at the transcriptional level. After the recently discovered inhibition by its antagonists of the transcription of Hsp70 in cancer cells by blockade of the activation of HSF118 20 (which is often upregulated and constitutively activated in tumour formation) we studied the effects of ibuprofen on HSF1 in A549 cells. We first performed a ChIP assay to explore whether the inhibitory effect of ibuprofen is at the level of HSF1 DNA binding. As expected we found an unequivocal association between HSF1 and the Hsp70 gene promoter containing the HSE site in ibuprofen-untreated cells (Figure 3a). It is noteworthy that ibuprofen eliminated this binding (Figure 3a) suggesting that it inhibits the expression of Hsp70 via the action of HSF1. This also suggests that ibuprofen blocks the binding of HSF1 chromatin or the steps which precede in several processes needed to activate HSF1. Therefore we broadened our analysis to examine the effect of ibuprofen on the expression of HSF1. Compared with unexposed control cells the HSF1 mRNA level was significantly lower in cells exposed to ibuprofen (bottom of Figure 3b). Consistent with its effect on the expression of mRNA ibuprofen also decreased the expression of HSF1 protein in a dose-dependent fashion (top of Figure 3b). To confirm the inhibition of HSF1-mediated Hsp70 by ibuprofen we lowered the amounts of HSF1 present in A549 cells by RNAi and studied its effect on the expression of Hsp70. The treatment of cells with HSF1 dsRNA decreased the Hsp70 level compared with that measured in cells untreated with dsRNA (Figure 3c). Ibuprofen decreased the expression of HSF1 by 16 in comparison with untreated cells whereas other NSAID had no effect (Table 2). Overall these observations indicate that ibuprofen inhibited the expression of Hsp70 by depleting the HSF1 in A549 cells. Ibuprofen accelerates the mitochondrial apoptotic process induced by cisplatin Several studies have found that mitochondria might be a direct and important target of cisplatin in sensitive cells.32 33 We studied the effects of ibuprofen on the depolarization of mitochondrial membranes and the cytochrome c release induced by cisplatin. A549 cells with or without cisplatin were incubated in absence or presence of ibuprofen and stained with JC-1. Treatment with cisplatin and ibuprofen lowered the mitochondrial membrane potential manifest by an attenuated red and an enhanced green mitochondrial fluorescence (Figure 4a lower right panel) compared with that observed with cisplatin alone (Figure 4a upper right panel) while control (Figure 4a upper left panel) or ibuprofen alone (Figure 4a lower left panel) produced the red-dotted staining pattern of polarized mitochondria. The intensity of green mitochondrial fluorescence in cisplatin-treated cells is significantly increased (36.56 to 55.56 ) by the co-treatment with ibuprofen. Ibuprofen also promoted the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria induced by cisplatin (Figure 4b). These findings unequivocally indicated that in A549 cells ibuprofen enhanced the mitochondria-dependent apoptosis caused by cisplatin. Ibuprofen increases the activation of Bax induced by cisplatin The translocation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax to the mitochondria is closely associated with the apoptosis induced by cisplatin. To explore the mechanisms by which ibuprofen promotes the apoptosis mediated by mitochondria in response to cisplatin we examined whether it was due to its ability to stimulate the translocation of Bax by cisplatin. We first monitored conformational changes in Bax as indicators of its activation. Western blot analysis of the immunoprecipitates with a conformation specific anti-Bax (6A7) antibody which only recognizes the active form revealed the presence of active Bax in A549 cells treated with cisplatin (Figure 5a lane 4) although not in untreated cells (Figure 5a lanes 1 and 2). Further exposure of the cisplatin-treated cells to ibuprofen caused a 1.5-fold increase in active Bax compared with incubation with cisplatin alone (Figure 5a lane 3).\nLabels: [Thyroid_Cancer, Colon_Cancer, Lung_Cancer]\nReply with one label only.", "assistant": "Lung_Cancer"}

Choose exactly one label.", "user": "Text: Purpose Although the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKI) gefitinib have shown dramatic effects against EGFR mutant lung cancer patients become resistant by various mechanisms including gatekeeper EGFR-T790M mutation MET amplification and KRAS mutation thereafter relapsing. AZD6244 is a potent selective and orally available MEK1 2 inhibitor. In this study we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of AZD6244 alone or with BEZ235 an orally available potent inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in gefitinib-resistant non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) models. Experimental design NCI-H1975 with EGFR-T790M mutation NCI-H1993 with MET amplification and NCI-H460 with KRAS PIK3CA mutation human NSCLC cells were subcutaneous injected into the athymic nude mice respectively. Mice were randomly assigned to treatment with AZD6244 BEZ235 AZD6244 plus BEZ235 or control for 3 weeks then all mice were sacrificed and tumor tissues were subjected to western blot analyses and immunohistochemical staining. Results AZD6244 could inhibit the tumor growth of NCI-H1993 but slightly inhibit the tumor growth of NCI-1975 and NCI-H460. Combining AZD6244 with BEZ235 markedly enhanced their antitumor effects and without any marked adverse events. Western blot analysis and immunohistochemical staining revealed that AZD6244 alone reduced ERK1 2 phosphorylation angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation. Moreover MEK1 2 inhibition resulted in decreased AKT phosphorylation in NCI-H1993 tumor model. BEZ235 also inhibited AKT phosphorylation as well as their downstream molecules in all three tumor models. The antiangiogenic effects were substantially enhanced when the agents were combined which may due to the reduced expression of matrix metallopeptidase-9 in tumor tissues (MMP-9). Conclusions In this study we evaluated therapy directed against MEK and PI3K mTOR in distinct gefitinib-resistant NSCLC xenograft models. Combining AZD6244 with BEZ235 enhanced their antitumor and antiangiogenic effects. We concluded that the combination of a selective MEK inhibitor and a PI3K mTOR inhibitor was effective in suppressing the growth of gefitinib-resistant tumors caused by EGFR T790M mutation MET amplification and KRAS PIK3CA mutation. This new therapeutic strategy may be a practical approach in the treatment of these patients. AZD6244 BEZ235 Tyrosine kinase inhibitor Non-small cell lung cancer Introduction Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in many countries including the China 1 . Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for up to 80 of all lung cancer cases; patients typically present with advanced disease at the time of diagnosis. The prognosis of patients with advanced lung cancer remains poor and recent studies show that conventional therapies may have reached a therapeutic plateau as evidenced by the 5-year survival rate for NSCLCs which remains at 15 23 . The EGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) gefitinib and erlotinib have shown marked therapeutic effects against NSCLCs with EGFR activating mutations such as exon 19 deletions and L858R point mutations 4 . Almost all tumors however acquire resistance to EGFR-TKIs after varying periods of time. Common mechanisms for acquired resistance include emergence of an EGFR gatekeeper mutation (T790M) and MET gene amplification 56 . In addition PIK3CA mutations as well as KRAS mutations have been found to contribute to EGFR-TKIs resistance in a subpopulation of tumors 78 . The limited therapeutic options currently available for patients with advanced lung cancer create a pressing need to identify new therapeutic strategy. Selumetinib (AZD6244) is an oral non-ATP competitive inhibitor and highly specific for extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK)1 2 a key enzyme in the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway. AZD6244 had minimal effects on the p38 c-Jun-NH2-kinase PI3K and MEK5 ERK5 pathways and is currently in phase II clinical trial in KRAS-mutant NSCLC 910 . In vivo AZD6244 could inhibit the tumor growth in HT-29 xenograft model which is a colorectal tumor model carrying a BRAF mutation at a dose of 100 mg kg and the tumor growth inhibition of AZD6244 is better than gemcitabine 11 . However the inhibition of MEK signaling alone may not be sufficient in patients with gefitinib-resistant NSCLC and negative feedback mechanisms in PI3K pathway may be problematic when it is used alone 12 . By contrast combined blockade of both pathways was able to overcome the reciprocal pathway activation induced by inhibitor-mediated release of negative feedback loops and resulted in a significant tumor growth inhibition. Thus coinhibition of both pathways has shown use in reducing tumor growth in a variety of xenograft models 1314 and clinical trials of such combinations are under way in adults. BEZ235 is an orally available dual inhibitor of PI3K and mTOR that is being evaluated in phase I II trials 15 . With the aim of developing effective therapeutic strategy for treatment gefitinib-resistant NSCLCs we have initially evaluated the antitumor activity of AZD6244 alone or combination with BEZ235 in a panel of three human NSCLC cell lines which were selected according to their different mutation status for EGFR-T790M MET and KRAS PIK3CA genes. We hypothesized that targeting the MEK pathway in combination with selective inhibitors of PI3K mTOR signaling could overcome gefitinib-resistant NSCLC and enhance the antitumor efficacy. Methods Reagents AZD6244 and BEZ235 were purchased from Sellech Chemicals (Houston TX USA) all drugs were dissolved in sterile dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and a 10 mM working solution was prepared and stored in aliquots at -22 C.

Cell lines The NCI-H1975 EGFR T790M mutation 16 NCI-H460 KRAS PIK3CA mutation and NCI-H1993 MET amplification 1718 human NSCLC cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Manassas VA USA). The cells were cultured in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10 FBS 100 mg L streptomycin 100 IU mL penicillin and 0.03 L-glutamine (Hyclone Logan UT USA) and maintained at 37 C with 5 CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. Cell viability assay Cell viability was measured using the MTT 3-(45-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-25-diphenyl tetrazolium dye reduction method. Tumor cells (1? ?104 cells 100 mL well) in RPMI1640 medium with 10 FBS were plated into 96-well plates and cultured with indicated compounds for 72 h followed by the addition of 50 mL of MTT solution (2 mg mL; Sigma St. Louis MO) to each well and further incubation for 2 h. The medium was removed and the dark blue crystals in each well were dissolved in 100 mL dimethyl sulfoxide. The absorbance of the wells was measured with a microplate reader at test and reference wavelengths of 490 nm respectively. Percent growth was reported relative to untreated controls. Each experiment contained at least triplicate samples and was performed at least three times. Efficacy study in vivo BALB C nude mice (female 6-7 weeks old) were obtained from Vital River (Beijing China). Mice were maintained under super pathogen-free conditions and housed in barrier facilities on a 12-h light dark cycle with food and water ad libitum. All animal experiments were performed in accordance with protocols approved by the Shandong University Experimental Animal Care and Use Committee. Mice were injected subcutaneous (s.c.) with 5? ?106 NCI-H1993 NCI-H1975 and NCI-H460 cells that had been resuspended in 200 ?L of matrigel (BD Biosciences Milan IT). AZD6244 solubilized in a methocel polysorbate buffer was injected by oral gavage twice daily at the dose of 25 mg kg for 3 weeks 19 . BEZ235 was reconstituted in NMP (1-methyl-2 pyrrolidone) and PEG300 and injected by oral gavage once daily at the dose of 20 mg kg for 3 weeks 20 . When the mean volumes of tumors were between 150 and 200 mm3 mice were randomly divided in four groups (ten mice per group). The tumor volume and body weight in each group were balanced. The animals were ear-punched for identification during the study. Two orthogonal diameters of the tumor are measured with digital vernier calipers and individual animal weights were weighed and recorded twice a week. Tumor volume (TV) are measured and recorded during treatment period by the formula: TV? ?Length? ?Width2 2. Growth inhibition from the start of treatment was assessed by comparison of the differences in tumor volume between control and treated groups. Tumor growth inhibition T C ratio is calculated by the following equations: T C ratio? ?(Vt?-?V0)Compound treated (Vt?-?V0)Control? ?100? . Western blot analysis The expressions of p-ERK1 2 p-AKT p-S6 p-MEK1 2 and p-4E-BP1 in tumor tissues were examined by Western Blotting. Fresh tumors in each group were resected after last treatment with AZD6244 and or BEZ235 for 2 h on Day 21 of the efficacy study. Tumor tissues were lysed by lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.4 150 mM NaCl 10 glycerol 1 Triton X-100 1.5 mM MgCl2 1 mM EDTA pH 8.0 100 mM NaF 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride 1 mM sodium orthovanadate 10 ?g mL aprotinin 50 ?g mL leupeptin and 1 ?g mL pepstatin A).

Cutting and mounting the section. Immunocytochemical analysis was performed according to the method described on the commercial kits to examine the expressions of CD31 and Ki-67 (Cell Signaling Technology Danvers MA USA). Caspase activity assay The apoptotic markers activity of caspase-3-8 and -9 were measured by using caspase colorimetric protease kits (Abnova Walnut CA USA). Fresh tumors in each group were resected after last treatment with AZD6244 and or BEZ235 for 2 h on Day 21 of the efficacy study and then tumor lysis containing 200 ?g of protein was incubated with 5 ?L of 4 mM pNA-conjugated substrate (DEVD-pNA IETD-pNA and LEHD-pNA) at 37 C for 2 h.

Results Effect of AZD6244 and BEZ235 on viability of gefitinib-resistant NSCLC in vitro Before evaluating the effect of AZD6244 BEZ235 and AZD6244 plus BEZ235 treatment on gefitinib-resistant NSCLC xenograft models in nude mice the sensitivity of cell lines to compounds was evaluated in vitro. Cell proliferation was analyzed by MTT assay in cells treated with 00.010.11 10 and 100 ?M of AZD6244 or BEZ235 for 72 h. The results showed that AZD6244 significantly suppressed the growth of NCI-H1993 with a low micromolar IC50 value of 5.6 ?M (Figure 1A). Moreover AZD6244 alone mildly inhibited cell growth with IC50 values of 37.5 ?M and 26.8 ?M in NCI-H1975 and NCI-H460 cells respectively (Figure 1A). BEZ235 alone also suppressed the growth of three cell lines with slightly high IC50 values of 23.5 67.8 and 16.8 ?M in NCI-H1993 NCI-H1975 and NCI-H460 cells respectively (Figure 1B). Figure 1 Anti-proliferative effects of AZD6244 and BEZ235 in NCI-H1993 NCI-H1975 and NCI-H460 gefitinib-resistant cell lines. Cells were treated with varying concentrations of AZD6244 (A) or BEZ235 (B) alone for 72 h. Doses ranged from 0.01 ?M to 100 ?M. Mean? ?SD n? ?5. Concurrent inhibition of MEK and PI3K mTOR has a synergistic effect on gefitinib-resistant NSCLC cell lines growth in vitro The anti-proliferative effect of combining a MEK and PI3K mTOR inhibitor was measured in NCI-H1993 NCI-H1975 and NCI-H460 cells by calculating the combination index (CI) according to the Chou-Talalay method 21 using a fixed dose ratio. Both AZD6244 and BEZ235 were introduced to cell cultures at 0.25 0.5 1 2 and 4 their respective IC50s in NCI-H1993 NCI-H1975 and NCI-H460 cell lines for 72 h. Cell growth in all cell lines was markedly decreased following combination treatment at multiple paired concentrations when compared with either single agent alone. The cells viability data were processed to get the CI under the corresponding effective dose (ED) in NCI-H1993 NCI-H1975 and NCI-H460 cell lines (Figure 2) by CalcuSyn software. For the NCI-H1993 cell line the following CI value was obtained: 0.4101 (ED50). For NCI-H1975 and NCI-H460 cell line the CI values were 0.02052 (ED50) and 0.0440 (ED50) respectively. The CI results suggested that AZD6244 and BEZ235 worked synergistically to produce an anti-proliferative effect in NCI-H1993 NCI-H1975 and NCI-H460 cell lines (Figures 2A-C). Figure 2 Synergistic effects of AZD6244-BEZ235 combination therapy on cell viability. NCI-H1993 (A) NCI-H1975 (B) and NCI-H460 (C) cells were treated with AZD6244 alone BEZ235 alone or AZD6244-BEZ235 in combination for 72 h. Results were analyzed according to the Chou-Talalay method 19 . The combination index (CI) values were calculated by using CalcuSyn software. Mean? ?SD n? ?5. Tumor growth inhibition effect of MEK and PI3K mTOR inhibitors in gefitinib-resistant NSCLC tumor models In order to investigate tumor growth inhibition effect of AZD6244 and or BEZ235 in vivo we used AZD6244 BEZ235 and AZD6244 plus BEZ235 to treat NCI-H1993 NCI-H1975 and NCI-H460 subcutaneous tumor models respectively for 3 weeks. As shown in Figure 3A-C treatment with AZD6244 for 3 weeks was able to inhibit tumor growth of NCI-H1993 (T C value 40 ) but slightly inhibit tumor growth in both NCI-H1975 and NCI-H460 subcutaneous tumor models (T C values 60 and 65 ) whereas BEZ235 treatment caused an approximately 50 reduction in tumor growth in all three subcutaneous tumor models. In contrast the combined treatments with the two drugs almost completely inhibited NCI-H1993 NCI-H1975 and NCI-H460 tumor growth at the end of the 3 weeks of therapy (Figure 3A-D).\nLabels: [Thyroid_Cancer, Colon_Cancer, Lung_Cancer]\nReply with one label only.", "assistant": "Lung_Cancer"}

respiratory disease influenza a virus iav initiates pulmonary inflammation and intensifies chronic lung diseases in response to the infiltration of inflammatory cells and augmentation of airway hyperresponsiveness the main target and host for iav is the bronchial epithelial cell which plays a key role in influenza pathogenesis infection occurs following h of influenza virus replication for the first cycle and then initial high titers of virus are shed during this period ifv infection can result in several symptoms like fever cough headache and pneumonia which may become immunologically incompetent while the induction of inflammatory cytokines by influenza infection is attributed to its systemic feature it is unlikely that the virus to be propagated outside the respiratory tract during an uncomplicated infection one of the key components of the influenza virus in pathogenesis is ha domain which is recognized by the host s neutralizing antibodies the emerged ha is directed to the cell membrane in an infected host cell fastening to the cell membrane by means of a short transmembrane region at the cterminal and once this domain attached to terminal sialic acid residues on the cell it facilitates entry and fusion of the virus due to the acidification of host cells by proton pumps ha rearranges so that the highly conserved nterminal of ha2 is exposed this exposure leads to the fusion of viral membrane with cell membranes and thus activation of the replication complex despite all known clinical and pathogenesis descriptions of the influenza virus the mechanism through which influenza virus disease being developed has not precisely understood however it is thought that local nonimmune cells which release early cytokines are the cause of many of the clinical signs

influenza virus in the context of preclinical studies mm2 can significantly reduce influenzaelicited proinflammatory cytokines such as il6 and tnfÎ moreover a slightly elevated ifnÎ level in the balf indicated the impact of this probiotic on the enhancement of nk cell activity these results along with the reduction of pulmonary mrna levels of nk cell activators including proinflammatory cytokine il1 and chemokines mip2 and mcp1 suggest the modulating effect of this probiotic on influenza infection in another study continuous oral administration of lactobacillus plantarum 06cc2 led to an elevation in the production of ifnÎ and th1 cytokines il12 and ifnÎ and reduction in the production of tnfÎ and il6 cytokines in balf this probiotic could also control the number of total infiltrated

study enterococcus faecalis1 has been proved to improve the body weight and feed conversion ratio of treated broilers and also significantly elevated the total igy serum level resulting in efficient modulation of the cecal microbiota and decrease in the mortality percentage of broilers an investigation on the possible effect of interaction between lactobacilli and chicken macrophages on eliciting antiviral responses against the aiv showed that certain probiotic species such as l acidophilus and l salivarius when administered as live bacteria either alone or in combination can induce an

siv revealed that the body weights of piglets fed with the probiotic and vaccinated with trivalent influenza vaccine significantly increased and noticeably higher h3n2specific antibodies were detected among them based on these considerations probiotics administration is effective in the secretion of high concentration of cytokines from immune cells located in the airway leading to the migration of immune cells to the lung space and thereby amelioration of influenza infection fig the probiotic effects on coronavirus infections m mahooti cytokines an increase in the level of total igg antibodies in pooled sera of treated mice and igg1 and igg2a isotypes demonstrated the efficacy of the probiotic in eliciting humoral immune responses and th1th2 responses respectively moreover it revealed that the level of inflammatory cytokines like il6 which increases upon influenza infection decreased in the probiotic group suggesting the ameliorating potential of this probiotic in influenzainfected mice based on the results of body weight changes survival rates and viral titre among treatment groups of different influenza viruses park showed that lactobacillus plantarum has antiinfluenza effects that are not virus type or straindependent revealing that regular intake of that probiotic can help to alleviate the influenza symptoms concerning the effect of longterm probiotic administration kiso orally injected lactobacillus pentosus b240 to mice for weeks and evaluated its inhibitory properties against influenza challenge assessment of different cytokineschemokines in the lungs of infected animals revealed that excluding il5 administration of that probiotic did not affect the immune system regarding cytokineschemokines secretion however ah1n1 pdm infected mice survived probably due to protecting effects of the probiotic by downregulation of acots acot1 acot2 and acot5 cyr61 egr1 and fos as well as upregulation of stfa1 and antiviral rsad2 genes in the lungs of uninfected mice in agreement with all aforementioned results harata revealed that oral administration of probiotics lactobacillus gg and l gasseri tmc035 in mice infected with a lethal dose of influenza ah1n1 pdm prompted the secretion of il12 il6 ifnÎ and iga from isolated pp cells in vitro however unlike lactobacillus gg the oral administration of l gasseri had no impact on the production of ifnÎ il6 as well as total iga in vivo proving the vital role of probiotic interaction with the component cells of galt in the protection against influenza the investigation of the effects of l casei strain shirota on aged mice showed that this probiotic can enhance not only the level of ifnÎ and tnfÎ but also pulmonary and spleen nk cells activity and thereby ameliorates ifv infection in another study oral administration of bifidobacterium longum bb536 could significantly reduce the loss of body weight inhibit viral proliferation in the lungs and improve the symptoms of influenzainfected mice which may be related to the decreased level of il6 belkacem observed that while administration of probiotic l paracasei induced significantly higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines in probioticfed influenza mice models this trend was reversed seven days upon influenza challenge except for il33 the number of all tissueresident or circulatory myeloid cells and b cells after the probiotic consumption and before viral infection increased and the probiotic administration generated more ifnÎproducing ilc1 mainly nk cells and th2 cells during the late phase of influenza infection additionally l paracasei peptidoglycans administration before influenza infection increased dendritic cells but did not affect other cell types and significantly reduced viral loads besides the effectiveness of oral administration of probiotics intranasal administration of lactobacillus pentosus spt84 to mice proved to induce the production of il12 and ifnÎ in mediastinal lymph node mln cells and il12 and ifnÎ in balf thereby improved the survival rates of mice reduced the ifv titer in balf and subsequently suppressed influenza infection in mice employing the novel sublingual route lee showed that in contrary to proinflammatory cytokines the level of il12 in the lung homogenates of mice treated with lactobacillus rhamnosus significantly increased in addition besides the increase in nk cell activities and antiinfluenza virus iga the expression of cd25 by both cd8 and cd4 lymphocytes highly increased in the lungs of mice these results recommend that compared to the traditional methods sublingual delivery is a more effective way for the administration of probiotics against seasonal and pandemic influenza regarding other animal models poorbaghi et al showed that microencapsulated lactobacillus acidophilus probiotic and its symbiotic form with inulin decreased faecal shedding of h9n2 avian influenza virus aiv in both nonvaccinated and vaccinated broiler chicks in the current outbreak of coronavirus disease covid19 reported from wuhan china has again gained global attention to taking a new measure that could work out as fast as possible against such an outbreak of viruses interestingly accumulated data obtained from clinical investigations on patients who suffered from severe covid19 in a hospital in wuhan demonstrated the presence of signs for cytokine storm especially among patients in severe stages of the disease particularly the levels of cytokines and chemokines involved in both th1 such as il1b ifnÎ and th2 il4 and il10 immune responses were promoted in studied patients moreover the levels of ip10 mcp mip1a and tnfÎ were in direct correlation with the severity of patients symptoms on the other hand it has been determined that the cytokine storm may lead to a rise in platelets and longer hospitalization of covid19 patients other studies also have revealed other aspects of virallydriven manipulation of immune responses by human coronaviruses therefore addressing the cytokine storm may be the key for the treatment of patients infected with sarscov2 while some reagents such as steroids can be considered as hyperinflammation suppressors their sideeffects impede to count on them as a trustworthy medicine for covid19 alternatively addressing the urgent need for standing against the increasing rate of morbidity and mortality related to the current pandemic requires employing previously approved therapies harnessing safety profiles probiotics as a safe available treatment with the ability to modulate immune responses and manipulate cytokines production have been considered to be studied against different strains of coronavirus in some studies soon moreover a clinical survey has reported an intestine microbiota imbalance in particular a decline in the level of probiotics such as lactobacillus and bifidobacterium among some covid19 patients which may result in secondary infection in response to bacterial translocation one report has shown that the recent outbreak of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv can be prevented through the use of either cell free supernatants cfs or live lactic acid bacteria lab it demonstrated that probiotics though the precise mechanism is not clear could be effective against the pandemic strain of pedv in a strainspecific manner using cpe reduction assays that further confirmed by qualitative immunofluorescence in another investigation lactobacillus casei was used as a carrier for the dctargeting peptide dcpep fused with the pedv core neutralizing epitope coe antigen this

of the interaction of active immune cells triggered by probiotics with respiratory viruses in the lung following virus infection immune cells in the airway such as dendritic cells and macrophages

resulting in rapid recruitment of activated t and b cells in the lung that eventually promote upregulation of virusspecific immunoglobulins and cytokines in probioticreceived subject whereas in the absence of activated immune cells the respiratory virus can cause severe lung damage due to the lack of immediate immune responses responses in mice models there have been other articles using different types of probiotics for displaying the desired genes or antigens against pedv for instance liu demonstrated that their modified lactobacillus plantarum has the property to act like a strong antiviral agent against coronavirus infection in the intestinal porcine epithelial cell line probiotic impacts on other viral respiratory infections eguchi et al demonstrated that lactobacillus gasseri sbt2055 lg2055 when administered orally to mice before infection with a human rsv could suppress the virus titre in lung tissue homogenates rsv replication and the intensity of the symptoms moreover a decrease in the expression level of proinflammatory cytokines and an increase in the mrna level of ifn ifnÎ oas1a and isg15 in the mice lung upon probiotic administration are satisfactory evidence for antiviral properties of this probiotic also swi2snf2related creb binding protein activator protein srcap introduced as a candidate for the antiviral activity of lg2055 against rsv to investigate whether probiotics can control the inflammatory pathway and modulate the coagulation system upon respiratory viral infection rhamnosus crl1505 was orally administered in rsv or ifv mice models the results elucidated that this probiotic could successfully modulate tlr3triggered immune coagulation reaction in the lung upon viral infection and prevent exacerbated respiratory injuries notably this study substantiated the vital role of probioticprovoked secretion of il10 in taming the coagulation system after the viral attack additionally in a study conducted by tomosada nasal administration of lactobacillus rhamnosus crl1505 and crl1506 has proved to modulate elevated respiratory levels of the proinflammatory mediators caused by administration of the viral pathogenassociated molecular pattern polyic moreover a nasal administration of the probiotic prior to pfu of rsv challenge improved resistance against rsv infection considering the effect of probiotics on the parainfluenza virus there is only one study evaluating the antiviral effects of oral administration of lactococcus lactis subsp lactis jcm5805 in a mouse model of murine parainfluenza virus mpiv1 infection the probiotic administration resulted in a rise in the survival rate of treated mice without any weight loss and also a decline in the lung histopathology scores compared to the nontreated group which was attributed to the incorporation of jcm5805 into cd11c immune cells in pp and thereafter activation of pp pdcs and ultimately elevation of ifns expression it is of note that although no activated local pdcs were observed at lung upregulation in ifnsinduced antiviral factors in the lung may be due to the delivery of ifns from the intestine of jcm5805fed mice into the lung studies reporting the effects of probiotic bacterias on respiratory viruses have been demonstrated in table supplementary section clinical evidence of probiotic immunomodulation in a pilot study intake of lactobacillus brevis kb290 has shown to curtail the incidence of influenza infection among schoolchildren with no adverse effects associated with consuming the

c butyricum probiotic was unable to alleviate the antibioticrelated disturbances in the gut microbiome of h7n9infected patients an increase in microbiota diversity and evenness gradually appeared through continuous administration of probiotics after antibiotic cessation additionally based on the evaluation of crp levels or bacteremia and pneumonia in the patients treated with probiotics the safety of probiotic administration was approved and no inflammatory effects were observed in another study conducted by wang the impact of lactobacillus rhamnosus gg administration on nursing home

the effectiveness of probiotics in reducing respiratory infections among senescent individuals similarly it has been shown that there is no connection between intaking the yogurt fermented with probiotic lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp bulgaricus oll1073r1 and incidence rate of influenza in humans however the immunological study showed an increase in the level of ifnÎ in the probiotictreated group while there are some available treatments for hrv the most frequent cause of the common cold most of them have failed to be efficient in clinical trials due to their drawbacks in this regard probiotics have shown to prevent or treat common colds and upper respiratory infections several studies have revealed that the rhinovirusrelated common cold pathogenesis is associated to the innate inflammatory response to the virus therefore more attempts have done to incorporate probiotics to modulate immune responses consequently leading to balanced responses and optimal outcomes in combating viral infection in this regard an investigation on the impact of bifidobacterium animalis ssp lactis bl04 on healthy adults showed a modest modulation of innate immune host responses upon infection

demonstrated that adults consumed juice enriched with live or heatinactivated l rhamnosus gg before intranasal inoculation of hrv showed no significant differences in nasopharyngeal hrv loads compared to the placebo group another survey has illustrated that consumption of probiotic is a good strategy to prevent viral rtis in the first year of life in a cohort of preterm infants the results showed that the probioticdriven change in microbiota leads to the induction of longlasting effects which can reduce the risk of viral rtis in agreement with that study it was demonstrated that live l

{"system": "You are a medical text classifier. Choose exactly one label.", "user": "Text: The blue nodes represent biomarkers identified in this work. The yellow nodes represent six genes which are not related with NSCLC on the NSCLC and normal specimens. The red nodes represent subtypes i.e. AC and SCC. Key gene pairs inferred by gene-subtype higher logic relationships We grouped together the gene-subtype higher logic relationships with the same logic function. Because the two logic functions AND (Type 1) and XOR (Type 8) have more intuitive biological interpretations than other logic functions we restricted our analysis to these two logic functions. The key gene pairs were defined as the gene pairs involved in the gene-subtype higher logic relationships with logic function AND or XOR. We obtained key gene pairs in total where and gene pairs were related with AC SCC through the logic functions AND and XOR respectively (Table S6). This result may be explained by the strict parameters we chose. Gene Ontology analysis The Gene Ontology (GO) is a structured and controlled vocabularies and classifications about the annotations of genes gene products and sequences 40 . GO includes three categories of terms: biological processes molecular functions and cell components. We were focused on the biological processes enriching the genes involved in lower logic relationships. So in what follows when we say GO terms it means the GO terms in the biological process category. According to probe-AC SCC pairwise associations and their uncertainty coefficients we obtained a gene set containing genes without overlap and each gene attached a coefficient. A total of genes were ranked in descending order by coefficients and given as input to the Gorilla. The Gorilla gave significant GO terms like tissue development (GO: 0009888) epidermis development (GO: 0008544) and epithelial cell differentiation (GO: 0030855) (Part A in Appendix S1). Given that the significant GO terms were retrieved based on the subtypes of NSCLC data it has to be checked whether the significant GO terms are also significant on NSCLC and normal specimens. The same procedure was applied to the ranked genes based on the NSCLC and normal data. The test revealed significant GO terms with significant value (Part B in Appendix S1). In total seven out of GO terms on the subtypes of NSCLC data were also significant on the NSCLC and normal specimens (). It indicates that the following seven biological processes are important for tumorigenesis of NSCLC: tissue development epidermis development epithelial cell differentiation anatomical structure development developmental process cell adhesion and biological adhesion. .0094644.t002 Significant GO terms. GO terms Description P-value1 P-value2 E1 E2 GO:0009888 tissue development GO:0008544 epidermis development GO:0030855 epithelial cell differentiation GO:0048856 anatomical structure development GO:0032502 developmental process GO:0007155 cell adhesion GO:0022610 biological adhesion P-value1 and P-value2 denote the p-value scores of GO terms based on the subtypes of NSCLC data and NSCLC and normal data respectively. E1 and E2 are the enrichment values of GO terms based on the subtypes of NSCLC data and NSCLC and normal data respectively. Further we grouped the genes closely related with the subtypes of NSCLC into two groups by the types of gene-SCC lower logic relationships. We mapped the genes which were related with SCC (AC) by Type () lower logic relationships to GO terms. Gene ontology analysis revealed GO terms with the p-value scores smaller than and the enrichment scores larger than . Among significant GO terms epithelial cell differentiation (GO: 0030855) and cell adhesion (GO: 0007155) were also involved in the seven significant GO terms which may be important for tumorigenesis of NSCLC. It indicates that dysfunction of epithelial cell differentiation and cell adhesion is important for both of the tumorigenesis of AC and SCC. In addition we mapped the identified biomarkers to GO terms. The resulted significant GO terms were cell adhesion (GO: 0007155) and epidermis development (GO: 0008544) with the p-value scores smaller than and the enrichment scores larger than . It indicates that genes annotated to epidermis development and cell adhesion may be differently regulated between AC and SCC. By mapping the higher logic relationships to GO terms we obtained pairs of GO terms with different GO terms. Among all pairs of GO terms pairs of GO terms involving GO terms were significant with the p-value scores smaller than enrichment score larger than one and the number of gene pairs larger than two. These combination of biological processes may be pivotal for differentiating AC and SCC including a combination of transport (GO: 0006979) and regulation of transcription DNA-dependent (GO: 0006355) a combination of oxidation-reduction process (GO: 0055114) and nervous system development (GO: 0007399) and a combination of negative regulation of cell proliferation (GO: 0008285) and muscle contraction (GO: 0006936). Discussion In this paper we improved the logic analysis method to infer sufficient and necessary conditions for the presence states (presence or absence) of a phenotype. The current method omits the integration of networks and identifies not only gene-phenotype pairwise combinations (i.e. lower logic relationships) but also triplets combinations (i.e. higher logic relationships). On one hand it avoids the incompleteness of data sources and the noise from the integration of data; on the other hand the triplets combinations reflect the combination effect of gene pairs on phenotypes other than an individual effect. Some examples of lower and higher logic relationships demonstrated the biological relevance of our results. However the accuracy of all discovered logic relationships cannot be verified because of the current limited knowledge of the relationships between genes and phenotypes. The statistics analysis strengthened the reliability of discovered logic relationships. In addition the current method was compared with the two earlier methods (the NMF method and the RA method). The current method was superior to the two earlier methods because of its ability of mining gene pairs which are closely related with phenotypes. Moreover the current method gained the higher recall rate and classification accuracy than the two earlier methods. Our results display the advantage of the current method in mining genes closely related with phenotypes. The discovered gene-subtypes logic relationships in this paper are equivalent relationships between the expression patterns (expression or no-expression) of genes and the presence states (presence or absence) of phenotypes. That is both a expression pattern of a gene and a presence state of a phenotype must be either simultaneously true or simultaneously false. For example DSC3 is expressed if and only if the specimen is SCC as DSC3 is related with SCC by the first type of lower logic relationship. If a gene is related with a phenotype by a logic relationship then either the expression pattern of a gene or the presence state of a phenotype may be determined by the underlying logic relationship. Concretely given a phenotype the expression pattern of genes in a phenotype could be determined by the logic relationship. For example the expression pattern of DSC3 in SCC depends on the type of DSC3-SCC lower logic relationship. Conversely given a expression pattern of a gene the presence state of a phenotype could also be determined by the underlying logic relationships. The type of a discovered gene-AC lower logic relationship was totally different from that of the gene-SCC lower logic relationship where the genes involved in two relationships are the same. It indicates that the totally different types of lower logic relationships between genes and phenotypes may be the intrinsic reason for the different expression patterns of genes in distinct phenotypes. A total of genes identified in our work were regarded as the biomarkers for distinguishing AC from SCC as well as novel molecular targets for targeted therapeutic agents. Besides the genes identified in the literature (DST CLCA2 KRT5 DSG3 GJB5 SERPINB13 TRIM29 PKP1 KRT6B DSC3 NKX2-1 TP63 and NTRK2) most of the rest genes (BNC1 FAT2 LASS3 and PVRL1) are likely to be the novel biomarkers to distinguish AC from SCC. The BNC1 gene is thought to play a regulatory role in keratinocyte proliferation and the LASS3 gene is participated in keratinocyte differentiation . Both of the biological process keratinocyte proliferation and keratinocyte differentiation are children of keratinization process . Because the genes involved in keratinization process are higher expressed in SCC as compared with AC 26 BNC1 and PVRL1 which are either a upstream regulatory factor or a member of these high expressed genes may be able to differentiate AC and SCC. FAT2 functions as a cell adhesion molecular and it controls cell proliferation. As cell adhesion is one of the significantly important biological processes for tumorigenesis of NSCLC the cell adhesion molecular (FAT2) is deserved to be a biomarker to distinguish AC from SCC. Until recently the function of LOC642587 and GOLT1A has been unknown. Further experimental validation is needed to confirm the differentiating ability of these two genes. In addition the NKX2-1 gene has been considered as a novel oncogene 35 and it opens new windows for novel targeted therapies 41 .\nLabels: [Thyroid_Cancer, Colon_Cancer, Lung_Cancer]\nReply with one label only.", "assistant": "Lung_Cancer"}

part of the national cancer institute s nci cancer moonshot initiative six healthcare systems will systematically integrate pros into clinical workflows and electronic health records ehrs additionally much attention surrounds the hype and challenges of the application of machine learning algorithms in clinical care including for a number of oncology use cases however there are concerns around biases and homogeneous training data sets thus machine learning has had limited implementation into clinical care considerable progress in genomics and computational medicine has ushered in a new era in precision oncology generating vast amounts of data much of which is publicly accessible for example the nci precision medicine initiativeoncology has had recent success defining genetically

applied thoughtfully these innovations risk propagating disparities and inequities operationalizing these informatics discoveries into routine cancer care also continues to present a diverse set of challenges objectivesgiven the rapid pace of cancer informatics research our objective was to conduct a survey of the literature for advancements over the past several years in three key areas of growth digital health machine learning and precision oncology we also highlight the ethical implications challenges and opportunities for each topic methodsa literature search was conducted in two

enhance communication and delivery of health services it includes mobile health health information technologies wearable devices telehealth or virtual health and personalized medicine as health systems transition from traditional officebased care to more continuous interactions with patients and caregivers emerging technologies are key drivers of the capture of patientgenerated health data currently it is still challenging to bring together disparate data streams generated by patients from technologies such as smartphones social media platforms wearable activity trackers and internet of things iot devices such as smart home sensors however multiple studies have begun to demonstrate the value of employing digital health technologies to improve cancer prevention and care for example apps and webbased interventions have been used to support exercise and in digital outreach efforts focused on cancer screening in a webbased exercise intervention to mitigate the effects of chemotherapy breast cancer patients demonstrated improvements on the sixminute walk test and abdominal back lower body strength compared to the control group over the eightweek study one study demonstrated that google search and facebook advertisements could be used to promote cancer screening these advertising campaigns were associated with increased visits to institutional websites and scheduled screening exams compared to the week before and after the campaign these studies reveal the potential for digital health apps to engage patients reach broad populations and improve physical activity outcomes in addition to being a vehicle to deliver interventions social media can be used for behavioral surveillance several studies explored communications within patient communities with the most common posts or tweets on the topics of clinical trials treatment and support taylor found evidence of differing levels of emotional informational and social support for patients with lung cancer across platforms ie facebook twitter macmillanuk which may be due to differences in user characteristics or the nature of selfmoderating communities in terms of engagement cho examined the relationship between melanomarelated instagram posts and engagement outcomes ie likes comments social support they found that posts about physical consequences decreased the number of likes but increased comments and perceived emotional support and that the inclusion of images increased the number of comments made about the posts overall these highlighted studies contribute to an understanding of participative engagement and experiences on social media platforms for written and visual cancerrelated content that is usergenerated and suggest that patients may have varied experiences related to social support across platforms and communitiesthere is mounting evidence that using pros for cancer care symptom assessments can improve survival quality of life and help patients remain longer on treatment when compared to usual care while there is a wide range of pros that could be assessed during cancer treatment and in survivorship several efforts have aimed to identify key domains relevant to improving outcomes in cancer care for example a clinical advisory group identified priority domains and measures to enhance cancer care which included distress and symptoms and unmet needs girgis then developed clinical recommendations from these domains mapped them into wellbeing categories and demonstrated that these recommendations could algorithmically provide automated clinical feedback there is also concern that the use of structured questionnaires to assess pros may limit the ability to capture the broad range of symptoms experienced by patients

discrimination over current clinical standards in dermatology several deep learning methods were found to be superior to dermatologists in diagnosing and detecting skin cancers wei also found employing deep learning approaches to classify lung pathology images yielded more accurate results when compared to pathologists additionally advancements have been made in mlbased cds tools for classification of skin lesions estimates of colon cancer outcomes based on various therapies and management of uterine cervical abnormalities given the lack of large imaging datasets for training

tool has shown promise in predicting protein structure from its genetic sequence crisprcas9 screens have also facilitated tremendous progress in identifying essential genes across cancer cell lines several studies have used ml to identify cancer subtypes using gene expression data and pathological images for example coudray established that ml algorithms could predict six of the most commonly mutated genes within adenocarcinoma lung cancer ml could also be used to assist pathologists in detecting gene mutations or cancer subtypes given the variety of data sources necessary to compare personalized cancer care pathways incorporating genetic clinical imaging cost and quality of life data into multifaceted cds tools could aid in reducing the cognitive load of clinicians precision oncologyprecision medicine is an evolving set of diagnostic and treatment paradigms which seeks to optimize and tailor safe and effective care for patients based on their individual characteristics precision medicine has been advanced considerably by cancer genomics increasingly discoveries using genomic technologies that have fueled translational research are impacting clinical settings single cell level assays are proving transformational in the understanding of tumor heterogeneity disease biology and treatment resistance and will likely play an increasingly important role in clinical research and precision medicine applications several studies have demonstrated the feasibility of large cohorts prospectively assayed using genomic technologies with turnaround times short enough to impact wear time for activity trackers this research highlights that wearable devices could provide accurate assessments of performance status and physical function to inform treatment selection and could serve as a viable proxy for pros machine learningrecent advancements in machine learning ml reveal opportunities for ml to transform cancer care the field has seen progress in early detection of cancers and improved diagnostic accuracy personalized therapeutics and clinical workflows in the last two years the field has also experienced substantial growth in fda approvals for algorithms including oncology applications for the detection of suspicious lesions and clinical decision support cds recent reviews have highlighted a number of promising mlbased knowledge extractions from unstructured and semistructured oncology data from ehrs social media platforms and online health communities using ehr clinical documents savova created a natural language processing nlp system

germline dna sequencing of a panel of approximately known cancer genes turnaround time to final report was less than days on average most of the somatic variants were not present in the large public database of somatic variants called the catalogue of somatic mutations in cancer cosmic at the time of the study suggesting a gap between finding a variant and interpreting its relevance to a patient

registries discussioninnovations in cancer informatics are abundant in the areas of digital health machine learning and precision oncology and have great potential in improving cancer care while there are considerable challenges there are also many opportunities for future research to advance cancer informatics as a field opportunities and implications for digital health in cancer caregiven the ubiquitous adoption of smartphones and growing ownership of wearable and iot devices digital health technologies have the unique capability to gather longitudinal data outside of clinical settings that could yield deeper insights into a patient s symptom experience or help identify modifiable risk factors for cancer interoperability standards and numerous us initiatives such as the 21st century cures act and the promoting interoperability program formerly named the meaningful use program are transforming the way individuals access medical services and manage their health thereby accelerating the meaningful application of digital health technologiesthe evidence base for digital health in cancer care is currently limited by small sample size short study duration and limited focus on digital accessibility underserved or underrepresented populations or the needs and psychosocial outcomes of caregivers of patients with cancer patients with cognitive or physical disabilities may not be able to use some technologies and different modalities are needed to reach patients based on their abilities preferences cultural norms level of training and lived environment caregivers may be an important bridge to reach patients who have technical physical or cognitive limitations but this is an understudied area many studies specifically exclude participants based on nonownership of a smartphone lack of internet access severity of medical conditions being on chemotherapy treatment or a recurrence of cancer yet these populations may be those who could benefit the most from digital health technologies and interventions as companies are increasingly engaged in acquiring and sharing individuals healthrelated information there are noteworthy concerns about data privacy security and the ethical use of digital health data given the growing number of partnerships between health systems pharmaceutical companies insurers and technology companies and the increased access by third parties to cloudbased patient data and associated analytical tools there is growing unease about data linkages and the potential for misuse and data breaches for example google recently sparked a federal investigation following their partnership with ascension due to concerns for sharing protected health information and a department of justice inquiry over their acquisition agreement for fitbit apple has several partnerships with insurers and pharmaceutical companies such as aetna and eli lilly and fitbit has partnerships with bristolmyers squibbpfizer alliance and humana recently it was revealed that the uk s national health service has given amazon free use of all health data under an alexa advice deal consumers may be unaware or inadequately informed about how their data are being used and by whom suggesting the need for greater transparency of privacy and data sharing practices and policies to be consumable at the patient level although the fda regulates some digital health apps or technologies the majority of apps available in the marketplace are not validated through rigorous research additionally it remains challenging for patients and caregivers to determine which apps are trustworthy effective and usefulimia yearbook of medical informatics 2020griffin 0c opportunities and implications for ml in cancer caremachine learning research has had meaningful advances in cancer prevention diagnostics and prediction this progress has been driven by increased availability of data and scalable computing infrastructures cloudbased platforms such as microsoft azure databricks google cloud automl and amazon web services sagemaker have simplified building training and deploying models though developers should be cognizant of the computational and environmental costs associated with cloudbased platforms realtime nlp and ml innovations within ehr systems are also being explored by companies like nuance and epic which could lead to better capture of tumor staging information as structured data elements through ambient computing despite the promise of ml to improve cancer care there are substantial challenges that must be addressed before ml is implemented into routine cancer care for instance women missed screening mammograms in the uk due to algorithm failure the ibm watson for oncology project highlighted a number of issues in the ml and oncology communities related to lack of validation and benchmarking data quality and subjectivity in interpretation of results data quality and availability challenges in healthcare are an acknowledged barrier to research particularly the paucity of data for underrepresented populations this may lead to biases since training data does not reflect the attributes of these populations yet may be applied in clinical care there are also growing concerns about the deskilling of physicians that could occur when some or all of the tasks become automated such as a drop in a clinician s diagnostic accuracy this has future implications for graduate medical education and how curricula may require transformation to address these emerging issuesgiven the large volume and diversity of training data needed for ml research federated learning approaches which do not require direct data sharing have strong potential but remain difficult to implement due to privacy preservation challenges furthermore the black box nature of many algorithms renders interpretation and benchmarking performance difficult to improve algorithm transparency price proposed a threestep framework for validating black box algorithms which involves having high quality training data and development procedures testing algorithm performance against independent test data and evaluating performance continuously even with benchmarking appropriate selection of realistic and biascontrolled test cases may still be an issue the intrinsic uncertainty in medicine introduces variations in results interpretation which also suggests that model performance criteria should be use case specific rather than based on standard scoring metrics in the era of deepfake ethical issues are inevitable if there are no appropriate regulatory frameworks for the deployment of ml algorithms health disparities could be widened due to lack of representative training data and the possible consequences from algorithm failures limit the current utility of implementing ml algorithms in realworld cancer care settings governance and policies for deployment audits of performance and implementation of best practices will be critical for safe implementation but these are not yet widely used within health systems to mitigate some of the challenges facing the field of ml several anizations have proposed ethical and regulatory frameworks the fda has proposed policies for ensuring safe and effective use of mlbased software for medical purposes including regulatory frameworks for software as a medical device for cds as well as a precertification program in realworld deployment into clinical care it is critical to have rigorous change protocols for algorithm modifications to ensure safety and to provide transparency to users during updates of algorithms however these may not be routinely implemented while mlbased cds tools can assist in automated detection classification or reporting safeguards are essential to proactively mitigate errors that may arise from these complex systems professional societies such as the american college of radiology along with several other us and international radiology anizations have released an exemplar consensus and guidance document on the importance of developing ethical standards for ml toolkits such as the american college of radiology s ailab framework that promote a vendorneutral approach to develop algorithms based on patient populations may also allow for extensibility of algorithms opportunities and implications for precision oncology precision medicine utilizes characteristics of individual patients but relies on populations of patients to actually guide treatment decisions even when highquality data are available experts may disagree about interpretation and actionability applied within a clinical setting perhaps more problematic is the bias that can arise when extrapolating findings to ethnic racial or age groups not wellrepresented in research cohorts despite the growing application of genomic testing in research and precision oncology use cases are still limited by lack of availability of codified data elements from molecular testing on tumor samples germline dna and serum biomarkers even for healthcare systems with advanced ehrs and cancer research efforts currently there are numerous opensource cancer genomics tools and ml training platforms that have the potential to accelerate cancer informatics research such as oncosim oncowiki and google collaboratory the nci informatics technology for cancer research program has a number of openaccess tools that support the analysis of genomic imaging and clinical data yet despite the momentum in precision oncology discoveries and actionability of results

Intermittent hypoxia (IH) a hallmark of OSA enhances melanoma growth and metastasis in mice. Objectives: To assess whether OSA-related adverse cancer outcomes occur via IH-induced changes in host immune responses namely tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Measurements and Main Results: Lung epithelial TC1 cell tumors were 84 greater in mice subjected to IH for 28 days compared with room air (RA). In addition TAMs in IH-exposed tumors exhibited reductions in M1 polarity with a shift toward M2 protumoral phenotype. Although TAMs from tumors harvested from RA-exposed mice increased TC1 migration and extravasation TAMs from IH-exposed mice markedly enhanced such effects and also promoted proliferative rates and invasiveness of TC1 cells. Proliferative rates of melanoma (B16F10) and TC1 cells exposed to IH either in single culture or in coculture with macrophages (RAW 264.7) increased only when RAW 264.7 macrophages were concurrently present. Conclusions: Our findings support the notion that IH-induced alterations in TAMs participate in the adverse cancer outcomes reported in OSA.

{"system": "You are a medical text classifier. Choose exactly one label.", "user": "Text: Sulindac is a ligand of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) an xenobiotic-sensing nuclear receptor that can be activated by chemical structures containing planar aromatic hydrocarbons and thus evokes a cellular response that to detoxify xenobiotics. AhR activation leads to transcriptional upregulation of the NQO1 gene 62 63 . In previous studies 30 64 65 sulindac and its two metabolites have been used to treat cancer cells at concentrations of 200 µM 1 mM i.e. the concentrations used in our present study. In addition to reducing the growth of polyps all three increase NQO1 activity and expression in colon cancer cells 28 and might therefore be good candidates to increase the cytotoxic effect of ?-lapachone against lung cancer cells. When two cancer cell lines CL1-1 and CL1-5 with low NQO1 expression and activity were co-incubated with sulindac or its metabolites and ?-lapachone much higher cell death was seen with the CL1-5 cells than the CL1-1 cells ( and 7). These results demonstrated that the effect of sulindac and its metabolites in upregulating NQO1 was greater in CL1-5 cells which has lower NQO1 level and activity than CL1-1 cells showing that sulindac and its metabolites can be used to increase the ?-lapachone sensitivity of cells with lower NQO1 levels. Many other compounds such as toxifolin 32 and resveratrol 66 can increase NQO1 expression or activity but are not FDA-approved. A search is underway for other compounds that can increase the activity or expression of NQO1 using high-throughput library screening and two compounds DMEBP and TRES were recently found to be potent NQO1 inducers with low toxicity 3 . These compounds may also be valuable in increasing ?-lapachone cytotoxicity for cancer cells with low NQO1 expression or activity. The NQO1 Inhibitor Dicoumarol or Transfection with NQO1 siRNA Inhibits the Effect of Sulindac on ?-lapachone Toxicity for Lung Cancer Cells Dicoumarol is widely used as a specific pharmacologic inhibitor of NQO1 and has been shown to inhibit both enzyme activity and expression 45 67 68 . NQO1 siRNA designed to specifically target NQO1 mRNA can lower the expression of NQO1 mRNA and protein. In our study both agents blocked the synergistic effect of sulindac or its metabolites and ?-lapachone on decreasing the survival of CL1-1 or CL1-5 cells. Although ?-lapachone is very toxic for many cancer cells cells with lower NQO1 levels are less sensitive. However from the present study we can conclude that sulindac and its metabolites increase NQO1 expression and enzyme activity and thus are potential synergistic drugs that might be used in combination with ?-lapachone to treat cancer cells with high resistance to ?-lapachone cytotoxicity.

Choose exactly one label.", "user": "Text: Finally because there is no head-to-head clinical trial comparing maintenance gefitinib with other maintenance drugs (eg erlotinib) after the standard chemotherapy of four chemotherapeutic cycles we have not conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis of gefitinib in comparison with other maintenance therapies. Although the current estimates were derived from just one study which is also the only phase III trial compared maintenance gefitinib treatment in patients with locally advanced metastatic NSCLC according to our literature search we believe that the analysis of our study based on a current Chinese phase III trial and the justifiable extrapolation approach can provide important reference information for decision makers in China. First of all the clinical study itself is a multicentre double-blind randomized controlled-trial (RCT) which represents the best evidence available and is deemed to be the most accepted scientific method of determining the benefit of a drug or a therapeutic procedure. Second the analysis method applied in our study was reliable and widely used in economic evaluations especially in the field of medical and health care. In addition the Log-logistic and two parameters Weibull model matched the survival curves of the clinical trial satisfactorily () which shows that the model we constructed can mirror the effectiveness data of the trial commendably. And then direct medical costs related to each strategy were estimated including maintenance gefitinib therapy treatment of major adverse events routine follow-up treatment for patients without progression follow-up treatment in PS state and terminal-phase cost. Although the costs originated from our previous study 26 the published literature 27 or estimates according to local charges based on expert opinion all of them stemmed from a Chinese health care system perspective as well as in view of patients with advanced NSCLC which echoed the purpose of the current study. Last but not least to reflect substantial uncertainty of the input parameters the sensitivity analyses (including OSA and PSA) were conducted for each key parameter and all sensitivity analyses revealed that the model we applied was robust to the results. In according to the recommended WTP threshold (3 per-capita GDP) of cost-effectiveness guidelines from WHO maintenance gefitinib therapy after the standard chemotherapy of four chemotherapeutic cycles in locally advanced metastatic NSCLC patients with unknown EGFR mutations is likely to be not cost-effective for Chinese mainland from the Chinese health care system perspective. Local governments with different economic level however could take fully into account covering maintenance gefitinib treatment. Because for rich regions (the per-capita GDP 8767) the new strategy seems to be a reasonable option and if the per-capita GDP ranges from 5900 to 8767 the maintenance therapy may be favourable in terms of the different cost-effective probabilities. Decreasing the price of gefitinib the most significant parameter that could reduce the ICER should be considered to as a preferential factor for meeting widely treatment demands in China. Prof. L.B.

The latter as discussed in Section 2.5 may generate undercoverage through the underestimation of the true sampling (co)variance. A comparison of the importance of the two sources can be provided by the assessment of undercoverage in the first scenario where linear and constant functions are actually among the options of the selection procedure and the underlying simulated association can be potentially recovered with no lack of fit. In this scenario AIC-selected models affected by overfitting show a coverage of 91 very close to the nominal value as illustrated in Table IV. The under-coverage seems to be proportional to the bias as confirmed by with a lower coverage corresponding to sections of the bidimensional space characterized by worse fit. Empirical coverage across the risk surfaces for three scenarios of exposure lag response associations (linear-constant plateau-decay and exponential-peak in each column). Results from m 500 simulated data sets with ns 400 subjects. The simulated examples with ns 200 and ns 800 generate approximately 150 and 600 uncensored events respectively. The versions of Tables IV V and for these examples are reported in Tables S2 S5 and Figures S9 S10 of the supporting information. The comparison suggests that varying the sample size does not dramatically affect the performance of the AIC-based test apart from the expected different power in identifying nonlinear and noncostant exposure time response associations. Consistently AIC-based selection seems to perform well across the range of number of subjects included in the analysis with a small bias and reasonable coverage. The results of this simulation study are consistent with previous findings on one-dimensional models for exposure lag response associations assuming a linear exposure response relationship 18. 5. Discussion In this contribution I illustrate a statistical framework for modeling temporal dependencies with time-varying exposures defined here as exposure lag response associations. The approach is based on the extension of distributed lag non-linear models a modeling class previously proposed in time series analysis 2324. The extended DLNM methodology brings together and extends previous methodological developments on the topic as summarized in. Briefly it provides a unified framework for different study designs and regression methods and is applicable to time series cross-sectional case-control survival and longitudinal data. A major advantage is the possibility to describe the lag structure of either linear or nonlinear exposure response relationships through the choice of two functions that define the association along the dimensions of the predictor and lags including most of the previous approaches as special cases. The example in illustrates how such flexibility is important for obtaining correct estimates of the association. Model specification easily accounts for previous knowledge on the association and incorporates assumptions on the phenomenon to be investigated through the choice of specific functions lag period and constraints. Interpretation of complex exposure lag response associations is aided by the definition of simple summary measures of effect and prediction and by graphical representation. The modeling framework is defined through a neat and compact algebraic representation including the derivation of measures of uncertainty such as standard errors and confidence intervals. Estimation is carried out with standard regression models which do not require specialized optimization procedures and may include terms for multiple exposure lag response dependencies as shown for radon and smoking here. The parameterization prediction and graphical representation are carried out with few general functions implemented in a freely available and documented software as discussed in. A key issue of the DLNM methodology is about selecting the appropriate model among different options for modeling the bidimensional exposure lag response relationship. The simulation study in indicates that AIC-based selection performs reasonably well over a range of 150 600 uncensored events while the strong penalty of BIC induces the selection of models too simple to recover the underlying dependency. The overfitting characterizing AIC-selected models in scenarios of simple exposure lag response dependencies does not seriously affect its performance a result in line with previous findings 18. However AIC-selected models also suffer from bias and undercoverage of confidence intervals to some extent. Part of this seems to be related to the limited flexibility of the functions applied in the simulation study and may be described as a smoothing problem rather that an inherent limitation of the estimators. It should also be noted that the simulation study only evaluates a limited set of exposure response and lag response shapes simulated under the assumption of independency. Different functions such as cubic splines and more complex exposure lag response surfaces will be assessed in future simulation studies. Also an extension of DLNMs with penalized splines characterized by higher flexibility can be explored as well exploiting previous research on bivariate smoothing techniques 3031. A related problem is about the inferential procedures being conditional on a posteriori selection of the best-fitting model. Previous studies on unidimensional models have proposed a correction for the inflation of type I errors in tests on a constant effect along lags 1727. However this approach is not easily extended to the bidimensional setting of exposure lag response associations and the definition of a hypothesis testing procedure for DLNMs is left to future developments. Although a posteriori selection may also be a source of undercoverage of confidence intervals its impact seems to be limited if compared with that associated with lack of fit at least in the simple scenarios investigated in the simulation study. Another limitation is the lack of a formal testing procedure on the hypothesis of independency. As suggested in Section 3.4 a graphical assessment of the proportionality of exposure response and lag response curves such as those in can help investigating the issue. Further research is needed to provide more consistent inferential procedures in this setting. The analysis of the temporal evolution of the risk associated with protracted time-varying exposures has straightforward applications in different research fields. For example the DLNM methodology may be used to characterize the risk of chronic exposures to occupational or environmental factors to differentiate the role of exposures sustained at different ages in life course studies or to define the temporal frame of beneficial or adverse effects of drugs in clinical trials and pharmaco-epidemiology. The development of this methodology and software implementation provide a promising analytical tool for biomedical research. 6. Software and data All the analyses presented in this paper were performed using the R software version 3.0.1 32. The DLNM modeling framework is fully implemented in the package dlnm 25 by using the expressly extended version 2.0.0. The permutational algorithm for simulating time-to-event data in the presence of time-varying exposures is implemented in the package PermAlgo 29 version 1.0. Both packages are available through R from its central repository. The data of the Colorado Plateau uranium miners cohort in the form of a comma-separated values file is included in the supporting information together with the R scripts for the analysis performed in the example and the simulation study of Sections 3 4 which are entirely reproducible.

The objective of this trial was to evaluate the association of the activity of erlotinib in the first-line setting in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with the development of a tolerable rash via dose escalation of erlotinib or tumor characteristics. Methods Patients with advanced NSCLC without prior systemic therapy were treated with erlotinib 150 mg orally per day. The dose was increased by 25 mg every two weeks until the development of grade 2 tolerable rash or other dose limiting toxicity. Tumor biopsy specimens were required for inclusion. Results The study enrolled 137 patients 135 were evaluable for safety and 124 were eligible and evaluable for response. Only 73 tumor samples were available for analysis. Erlotinib dose escalation occurred in 69 124 patients. Erlotinib was well tolerated with 70 of patients developing a grade 1 2 rash and 10 developing grade 3 rash. Response rate and disease control rate were 6.5 and 41.1 respectively. Median overall survival was 7.7 months.\nLabels: [Thyroid_Cancer, Colon_Cancer, Lung_Cancer]\nReply with one label only.", "assistant": "Lung_Cancer"}
{"system": "You are a medical text classifier. Choose exactly one label.", "user": "Text: To understand the functional consequences of GWAS loci is challenging and multiple principles for post-GWAS functional characterization of genetic loci have been proposed including the exploration of epigenetic mechanisms46. In our study the top GWAS lung cancer loci were strongly associated with methylation levels of CpG sites in nearby gene bodies through cis-regulation and adjusting for smoking status or intensity did not change the results. Furthermore SNPs affecting the DNA methylation of gene bodies (which are typically methylated) were also collectively associated with risk for squamous cell carcinoma after excluding the established GWAS loci and were enriched for genes in cancer pathways. In contrast no enrichment was observed for SNPs affecting the methylation of gene promoters or CGI regions which are typically not methylated in normal tissues. This suggests a potential novel mechanism for genetic effects on cancer risk. In fact gene body-enriched cis-meQTLs outside CGI regions may increase the risk for germline and somatic mutations due to their increased propensity to become mutated1112. Upon spontaneous hydrolytic deamination methylated cytosine residues turn into thymine which are less likely to be efficiently repaired than the uracils that result from deamination of unmethylated cytosine residues. For example about 25 of mutations in TP53 in cancers are thought to be due to epigenetic effects47. Indeed analyses of comprehensive human catalogues of lung tumors have identified frequent G T mutations enriched for CpG dinucleotides outside CGI regions suggesting a role for methylated cytosine since CGI as we confirmed are usually unmethylated48. A similar signature was recently observed in other tumors14. Thus inherited genetic variation may have a profound impact on carcinogenesis by regulating the human methylome. We observed a high similarity of genetic control on DNA methylation across tissues. Since tissue of origin determines cancer-associated CpG island promoter hypermethylation patterns49 a natural question is whether the genetic regulation of methylation is tissue specific. While the tissue-specificity of eQTLs has been investigated for a few tissues50 for cis-meQTL only a recent investigation was conducted6 showing that 35.7 of 88751 cis meQTLs detected in 662 adipose samples were replicated in 200 whole blood samples. We found that a large proportion of meQTLs in EAGLE lung samples particularly those with large effect sizes were robustly replicated in breast and kidney tissue samples from TCGA suggesting a high similarity of genetic regulation of methylation across these tissues and related impact on somatic mutation rates1448. The lower replication rate of adipose meQTLs in whole-blood samples6 might be explained by the heterogeneity of different cell types in whole blood and by their more liberal P-value threshold (8.6 10?4) which led to the identification of a large number of weak cis-meQTLs. Compared with cis-regulation trans-eQTL regulation is typically considered to be more complex has smaller effect sizes and is more difficult to be replicated even in the same tissue. However in our study the lung trans-meQTLs are highly reproducible in TCGA lung breast and kidney tissues. Notably this similarity allows mapping meQTLs with substantially improved power by borrowing strength across tissues51. meQTL SNPs are strongly associated with multiple epigenetic marks. Chromatin regulators play a role in maintaining genomic integrity and anization52. We found that meQTL SNPs were strongly enriched for DNase hypersensitive sites and sequences bound by CTCF or modified histones. SNPs could affect these epigenetic marks by several mechanisms such as by affecting the core recognition sequences (exemplified for rs2816057 on chromosome 1 for CTCF) causing loss or gain of a CpG within a binding region which when methylated could affect binding27 or altering the binding sequence for interacting factors53. CTCF could cause changes in epigenetic marks through its multiple key roles including genome anization through mediating intra- and inter-chromosomal contacts5455 the regulation of transcription by binding between enhancers and promoters5456 and the regulation of splicing which may impact tissue specificity during tissue development39. These changes can impact regulation of distant genes and not the genes proximal to the SNPs that would be typically investigated in eQTL studies. This may be one reason for the previously observed lack of correlation between eQTLs and meQTLs347. Future large studies integrating SNP profiles the DNA methylome and transcriptome data through tissue developmental stages will hopefully shed light on this possibility. There may be a myriad of other DNA-binding factors whose binding is directly or indirectly affected by SNPs. For example among the histone marks the strongest enrichment of meQTLs in our study was for H3K4me3 in both SAEC and hAEC cell types. As H3K4me3 is the chromatin mark primarily associated with regulatory elements at promoters and enhancers this suggests a strong influence of meQTLs on regulating gene activity. Unfortunately transcription factor binding data in SAEC or hAEC are not available so we could not test whether SNPs in their core sequence could affect the deposition of epigenetic marks e.g. by recruiting DNA methyltransferases57. It will be important to obtain ChIP data from relevant primary cells for numerous DNA-binding regulatory factors to further elucidate the mechanisms whereby meQTLs and other SNP-affected epigenetic marks arise. In we show here that genetic variation has a profound impact on the DNA methylome with implications for cancer risk tissue specificity and chromatin structure and anization. The meQTL data (Supplementary Data) attached to this manuscript provides an important resource for studying genetic-DNA methylation interactions in lung tissue. Methods Sample collection We assayed 244 fresh frozen paired tumor and non-involved lung tissue samples from Stage I to IIIA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases from the Environment And Genetics in Lung cancer Etiology (EAGLE) study18. EAGLE includes 2100 incident lung cancer cases and 2120 population controls enrolled in 2002 2005 within 216 municipalities of the Lombardy region of Italy. Cases were newly diagnosed primary cancers of lung trachea and bronchus verified by tissue pathology (67.0 ) cytology (28.0 ) or review of clinical records (5.0 ). They were 35?79 years of age at diagnosis and were recruited from 13 hospitals which cover over 80 of the lung cancer cases from the study area. The study was approved by local and NCI Institutional Review Boards and all participants signed an informed consent form. Lung tissue samples were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen within 20 minutes of surgical resection. Surgeons and pathologists were together in the surgery room at the time of resection and sample collection to ensure correct sampling of tissue from the tumor the area adjacent to the tumor and an additional area distant from the tumor (1 5 cm). The precise site of tissue sampling was indicated on a lung drawing and the pathologists classified the samples as tumor adjacent lung tissue and distant non-involved lung tissue. For the current study we used lung tissue sampled from an area distant from the tumor to reduce the potential effects of field cancerization. DNA methylation profiling and data quality control Fresh frozen lung tissue samples remained frozen while approximately 30 mg was subsampled for DNA extraction into pre-chilled 2.0 ml microcentrifuge tubes. Lysates for DNA extraction were generated by incubating 30 mg of tissue in 1 ml of 0.2 mg ml Proteinase K (Ambion) in DNA Lysis Buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.0) 0.1 M EDTA (pH 8.0) and 0.5 (w v) SDS) for 24 hrs at 56 C with shaking at 850 rpm in Thermomixer R (Eppendorf). DNA was extracted from the generated lysate using the QIAamp DNA Blood Maxi Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer s protocol. Bisulfite treatment and Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip assays were performed by the Southern California Genotyping Consortium at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) following Illumina s protocols. This assay generates DNA methylation data for 485512 cytosine targets (482421 CpG and 3091 CpH) and 65 SNP probes for the purpose of data quality control. Raw methylated and unmethylated intensities were background corrected and dye-bias equalized to correct for technical variation in signal between arrays. For background correction we applied a normal-exponential convolution using the intensity of the Infinium I probes in the channel opposite their design to measure non-specific signal58. Dye-bias equalization used a global scaling factor computed from the ratio of the average red and green fluorescing normalization control probes. Both methods were conducted using the methylumi package in Bioconductor version 2.11. For each probe DNA methylation level is summarized as a ?-value estimated as the fraction of signal intensity obtained from the methylated beads over the total signal intensity. Probes with detection P-values of 0.05 were considered not significantly different from background noise and were labeled as missing. Methylation probes were excluded from meQTL analysis if any of the following criteria was met: on X Y chromosome annotated in repetitive genomic regions annotated to harbor SNPs missing rate 5 . Because the ?-values for the 65 SNP probes are expected to be similar in matched pair of normal and tumor tissues we performed principal component analysis (PCA) using these 65 SNP probes to confirm the labeled pairs. We then performed PCA using the 5000 most variable methylation probes with var 0.02 and found that the normal tissues were clustered together and well separated from the tumor tissues. We further excluded 5 normal tissues that were relatively close to the tumor cluster. From the remaining 239 normal tissue samples we analyzed 210 with genotype data from a previous GWAS of lung cancer20. Genotype data and genetic association analysis The blood samples were genotyped using the Illumina HumanHap550K SNP arrays in EAGLE GWAS20. The SNPs with call rate 99 minor allele frequency (MAF) 3 and Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) P-value 10?5 were included for analysis. Prior to meQTL analysis each methylation trait was regressed against sex age batches and PCA scores based on methylation profiles. The regression residues were then quantile-normalized to the standard normal distribution N(01) as traits. The genetic association testing was performed using PLINK and R adjusted for the top three PCA scores based on GWAS SNPs to control for potential population stratification. Identification of cis-meQTLs For each CpG methylation probe the cis region was defined as being less than 500kb upstream and downstream from the target CpG-site (1Mb total). A methylation trait was detected to harbor a cis-meQTL if any SNP in the cis region had a SNP-CpG nominal association P-value less than P0 where P0 was chosen to control FDR at 5 by permutations. Here we describe a permutation procedure to choose P0 to control FDR at 5 . For a given P0 let N(P0) be the total number of CpG probes with detected cis-meQTLs and N0(P0) the expected number of CpG probes falsely determined to have cis-meQTLs. FDR is defined as N0(P0) N(P0). The key is to estimate N0(P0) under the global null hypothesis that no CpG probe has cis-meQTLs. We randomly permuted the genotypes across subjects for 100 times keeping the correlation structure of the 338456 methylation traits in each permutation. Then N0(P0) was estimated as the average number of methylation traits that were detected to harbor cis-meQTL SNPs with nominal P P0. Control FDR at 5 requires P0 4.0 10?5. The same procedure was applied to detect secondary independently associated cis-meQTL SNPs. With our sample size h2 0.12 is required to detect cis-meQTLs with power greater than 0.8. We note that although we excluded all CpG probes annotated with SNPs there is still the possibility that rare not annotated variants could be associated with the cis-meQTL SNPs. However since common variants and rare variants are known to be poorly correlated and rare variants are uncommon by definition we do not expect this event to be frequent. Identification of trans-meQTLs For each CpG probe the trans region was defined as being more than 500kb from the target CpG-site in the same chromosome or on different chromosomes. For the kth methylation trait with m SNPs in the trans region let (qk1?qkm) be the P-values for testing the marginal association between the trait and the m SNPs. Let pk min(qk1?qkm) be the minimum P-value for m SNPs and converted pk into genome-wide P-value Pk by performing one million permutations for SNPs in the trans region. Because a cis region is very short ( 1M) compared to the whole genome ( 3000M) Pk computed based on SNPs in trans regions is very close to that based on permutations using genome-wide SNPs. Thus we use the genome-wide p-value computed based on all SNPs to approximate Pk. Furthermore all quantile-normalized traits follow the same standard normal distribution N(01); thus the permutation-based null distributions are the same for all traits. We then applied the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to (P1?PN) to identify trans-meQTLs by controlling FDR at 5 . With our sample size h2 0.24 is required to detect trans-meQTLs with power greater than 0.8. Replication of meQTLs in TCGA samples The replication was performed in TCGA histologically normal tissue samples that had genome-wide genotype (Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0) and methylation profiling (Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip). We downloaded genotype (level 2) and methylation data (level 3) from the TCGA website22. We also downloaded methylation data for tumor tissue samples and performed PCA analysis to confirm that normal tissue samples were separated from tumor tissue samples. Autosomal SNPs with MAF 3 calling rate 0.99 and HWE P-value 10?5 were included for imputation using IMPUTE259 and reference haplotypes in the 1000 Genome Project60 (version 2012 03). We only included samples of European ancestry based on EIGENSTRAT analysis. The replication set had 65 lung 87 breast and 142 kidney histologically normal tissue samples after QC. Again each methylation trait was regressed against sex age batches and PCA scores based on methylation profiles. The regression residues were then quantile-normalized to the standard normal distribution N(01) as traits for meQTL analysis. The associations were tested between the quantile-normalized methylation traits and imputed genotypic dosages adjusting for sex age and PCA scores based on SNPs. A genetic association detected in EAGLE lung data was considered replicated if the association had the same direction and FDR 0.05 based on single-sided P-values. Testing genetic associations with methylation and gene expression traits We downloaded gene expression data (level 3) from RNA-seq analysis of 59 histologically normal tissue samples from NSCL patients from TCGA. All samples also had genome-wide genotype data and 28 samples had additional methylation data from Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChips. Regression analysis was performed to test the association of gene expression with methylation levels in the CHRNA5 gene and with methylation levels in PABPC4 STARD3 and SLC35A3 genes. We tested the association between lung cancer GWAS risk SNPs and gene expression using regression analysis under an additive model adjusting for age sex and PCA scores based on genome-wide SNPs. Testing for enrichment of cis-meQTLs in lung cancer GWAS We tested for enrichment in NCI lung cancer GWAS of European ancestry which included three main histologic subtypes of lung cancer (adenocarcinoma (AD) squamous cell carcinoma (SQ) small cell carcinoma (SC)) and a small number of other lung cancer subtypes. We investigated whether the identified cis-meQTL SNPs were collectively associated with lung cancer risk which was tested by examining whether the GWAS P-values for these SNPs deviated from the uniform distribution (i.e. no enrichment). Because the high linkage disequilibrium (LD) in SNPs increased variability of the enrichment statistic and caused a loss of power we first performed LD-pruning using PLINK so that no pair of remaining SNPs had a r2 ?0.8. The enrichment significance was evaluated by 10000 random permutations. The genomic control ?-values61 based on genome-wide SNPs were 1.010.995 0.977 and 1.00 for overall lung cancer AD SC and SQ respectively. Thus the type-I error rates of our enrichment tests were not inflated. The detailed procedure for testing a set of cis-meQTL SNPs is described as follows: Firstly we performed LD-pruning using PLINK so that no pair of remaining SNPs had an r2 ?0.8. Secondly we tested the association for the LD-pruned SNPs (assuming K SNPs left) in a GWAS and computed the P-values (p1?pK). We then tested whether (p1?pK) followed a uniform distribution i.e. no enrichment. Thirdly we transformed P-values into ?12 quantitles qk F?1(1 ? pk) with F( ) being the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of ?12. We defined a statistic for testing enrichment as Q ?k 1Klog(1?f fexp(qk 2))3562 where f is a pre-specified constant reflecting the expected proportion of SNPs associated with the disease. Because only a small proportion of SNPs may be associated with the disease we set f 0.05 for this paper. The statistical power was insensitive to the choice of f in the range of 0.01 0.1 62. Finally the significance of the test Q was evaluated by 10000 random permutations. meQTL mediation analysis We investigated whether trans associations were mediated by the methylation levels of CpG probes nearby the trans-acting SNPs. Note that this analysis was only for trans associations with cis effects i.e. the SNP was associated with at least one proximal CpG probes with p 4 10?5. See Fig. 2c. Suppose a SNP G cis-regulates K proximal ( 500kb) CpG sites A1?AK with P 4 10?5 and trans-regulates a distal CpG site B. We performed a linear regression: B ? ?G ?kAk. We also computed marginal correlation coefficient cor(GB) and partial correlation coefficient cor(GB Ak) using an R package ppcor 63. A full mediation was detected if G and B were not significantly correlated after conditioning on Ak or equivalently G was not significant (p 0.01) in regression analysis B ? ?G ?kAk for any k. A partial mediation was detected if any Ak had a P 0.05 K (Bonferroni correction) in the regression analysis and cor(GB) ? cor(GB A) 0.1. An independent effect model (i.e. no mediation) was detected otherwise. Testing enrichment of meQTL SNPs in regulatory regions We obtained peak data for CTCF DNaseI H3K27me3 H3K4me3 and H3K36me of small airway epithelial cells (SAEC) from the ENCODE project and for H3K27me3 H3K4me3 and H3K9-14Ac from human alveolar epithelial cells (hAEC) from our own laboratory. A SNP is determined to be functionally related to a given mark or CTCF binding site if the SNP or any of its LD SNPs (r2 ?0.8 with LD computed using the genotype data of European population in The 1000 Genome Project) resided in any of the mark regions or CTCF binding sites. We explain our enrichment testing using CTCF as an example. We classified genome-wide SNPs into four categories: SNPs not associated with CpG probes in trans or cis (defined as control SNP set) SNPs only associated with proximal CpG probes via cis-regulation (cis-only21119 SNPs) SNPs only associated with distal CpG probes via trans-regulation (trans-only 192 SNPs) and SNPs detected with both trans and cis effects (cis trans 277 SNPs). For SNPs in the category of cis-only trans-only and cis trans we computed the proportion of SNPs functionally related to CTCF. To compute the enrichment of cis-meQTLs in CTCF binding sites we defined a control set of SNPs that are not associated with CpG probes via cis- or trans regulation. The selection of the control set was further complicated by the following two observations. (1) cis-meQTL SNPs tended to be more common (data now shown). (2) The probability of a SNP detected as a cis-meQTL SNP positively depended on the density of the CpG probes in the nearby region. Choosing a control set while ignoring these two factors could underestimate the proportion of functionally related SNPs in the control set and thus overestimate the enrichment for cis-meQTLs. Therefore we created 1000 sets of control SNPs with CpG probe density (measured as the number of CpG probes in the cis region of each SNP) and MAF matched with the meQTL SNP set and then averaged the proportions on the 1000 sets. The enrichment was calculated as the fold change with the proportion in the control SNP set as baseline. Next we investigated whether the enrichment was stronger for SNPs more significantly associated with CpG sites. Because we detected only a few hundred trans-meQTLs we focused this analysis on the set of cis-meQTLs. We classified cis-meQTL SNPs into five categories according to the cis-association P-values: P 10?7 (the weakest) 10?10 P ?10?7 10?15 P ? 10?10 10?20 P ? 10?15 and P ? 10?20 (the strongest). For each category we computed the proportion of SNPs functionally related to CTCF binding sites. meQTL SNPs affect CTCF binding We found that meQTL SNPs are strongly enriched in CTCF consensus sequences. We used SAEC data from ENCODE to test whether meQTL heterozygous SNPs directly affect CTCF binding by disrupting the CTCF recognition sites. P-values were calculated based on a binomial distribution Binom(N 0.5). Here N is the total number reads covering the SNPs. Raw sequencing data (.fasstq format) from SAEC cells were generated at the University of Washington as part of the ENCODE project and downloaded from the UCSC genome browser. Raw data was aligned to the hg19 genome using CLC genomics workbench (v 5.5.1) parsing out data with less than 80 contiguous alignment to the genome and duplicate reads in excess of 10 copies. We used the CTCFBSDB 2.0 program64 to predict whether the meQTL SNPs or their LD SNPs (r2 ? 0.8) were within CTCF peaks and then examined in SAEC whether CTCF exhibited allele-specific binding. Because common SNPs are more likely to be heterozygous we only looked for SNPs with MAF ?0.4. Here we present two such examples. Systematic investigation of all meQTL SNPs that are heterozygous in SAEC is warranted once more samples with genotypic data are available.

hematologic neoplasia such as leukaemias as the detailed understanding of the combination induced molecular effects is often lacking the identification of combination induced molecular mechanisms

while children are reported to have a longterm survival probability of approximately in adults relapsefree survival is lower than patients showing mixedlineage leukaemia mll rearrangements display even lower survival rates all therapy is currently dominated by the application of cytostatic agents according to the current clinical practice guidelines however severe side effects development of drug resistance and relapse limit the therapeutic success the introduction of pathway specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors tki such as imatinib and immunotherapeutics such as the anticd20 antibody rituximab have advanced curative treatment in chronic leukaemia the 3kinase pi3k represents a key molecule within the b cell receptor bcr pathway and different tkis are currently evaluated to target this kinasephosphatidylinositol45bisphosphate idelalisib idel is a selective pi3k pathway inhibitor targeting the Î subunit mono and combined administration of idel were approved for the treatment of indolent nonhodgkin lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia however postmarketing surveillance suggested increased mortality caused by infections as a side effect of idel the molecular mechanisms leading to this observed side effect are not yet fully understood idel preferentially targets the deltasubunit pi3kÎ p110Î of the pi3k kinase which plays a key role in signal transduction cell proliferation and survival energy metabolism cellular motility and cell cycle progression the kinase is highly activated in several tumour types of different origins consequently pi3k is targeted in several novel therapeutic approaches table a0the introduction of tkis such as idel enabled the evaluation of new drug combinations potentially featuring lower doses of the individual drugs and thereby reducing side effects and drug resistance in turn understanding the respective combination modes of action is critical for a rational selection of the best candidate drugs introduction of nextgeneration sequencing such as whole genome and exome sequencing and rnasequencing provided profound knowledge of the disease acting molecular mechanisms especially rnasequencing has been of considerable value as mrna allowed to characterise drug combination action as well as drug combination induced effects therefore in the present study the cellbiological and molecular effects of the

addressed cell line the combination led to enhanced antiproliferative effects on the cellular level characteristic gene regulation and expression thereby the specific exclusively regulated genes and pathways were identified in both mllpositive proball cell lines the focus here is on mono and combined therapy of maximum two agents in cell lines and adds insights into the previously gained knowledge of expression profiling as well as fusion gene detection in patients with ball using standard treatment regimen containing arac and dex addition of a0idel to a0arac results in a0pronounced anti proliferative effects independent from a0arac sensitivitya different aracsensitivity characterises both cell lines while a0µm arac exposure reduces rs411 proliferation to approx half sem proliferation is inhibited to nearly by the 100fold lower concentration the addition of idel induced in both cell lines independently from their characteristic aracsensitivity an enhanced decrease of proliferation interestingly arac exposure led to an increase of metabolic activity in both cell lines while the addition of idel leads to a proportional ratio of remaining cells and corresponding metabolic activity further the addition of idel initiates an increase of the number of regulated genes and stronger modulated gene expression levels further the addition of idel led to a modulation of genes belonging to the tgfbeta signalling pathway in both cell lines this pathway is an essential regulator of proliferation differentiation migration and cell survival additionally several genes regulating cellular key processes as proliferation and cell cycle were found regulated explicitly by the addition of idel exemplarily various histones with direct effect on dnapackaging were found downregulated and thus influence dnareplication further the elongation factor eif5al1 was found exclusively downregulated by arac idel in rs411 both mechanisms show a specific enhancement of cell division critical checkpoints which could be mediators of the observed cellular responsegenes snora12 nme1nme2 cyp3a4 and steap1 were exclusively downregulated by arac idel these genes are described to be found overexpressed in cancer of different origins while snora12 is found upregulated in lung cancer nme1nme2 upregulation is described to promote the survival of aml cells steap1 overexpression is detected in different cancer types and was associated with a poorer prognosis for aml multiple myeloma diffuse large b cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer accordingly the observed exclusively downregulation potentially represents a molecular mechanism resulting in the enhanced antiproliferative effects of arac idel further we detected a selective downregulation of cyp3a4 cyp3a4a290g polymorphism that resulted in overexpression was found in many acute myeloid leukaemia aml samples additionally an overexpression in breast cancer had been detected cyp3a4 is responsible for the detoxification of more than of the drugs on the other hand we discovered an exclusive downregulation of kcnj1 this gene is reported to inhibit proliferation and metastasis in renal cell carcinoma currently data of kcnj1 for leukaemia is missing the examined downregulation of these genes by arac idel may contribute to the more potent effect of the drug combination in comparison to the respective mono applicationwhile the previous represents the loss of prooncologic cellular features also gain of function modulations were observed leading to the enhanced antiproliferative molecular mechanism exemplarily creb3l3 was found exclusively upregulated while dlx2 expression was found stronger upregulated by the combination creb3l3 overexpression suppresses proliferation in hepatoma 0csklarz a0et a0al cancer cell int page of cells and has been described to be downregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma dlx2 is reported to be downregulated in paediatric precursor balls carrying mllrearrangement and may be induced during metabolic stressinduced necrosis these functional gene modulations represent candidate mechanisms mediating the observed enhanced antiproliferative effects in the all cell linesinterestingly in all similar cell biological effects were observed showing that the addition of pi3k or mtor inhibitors to arac was able to induce enhanced antiproliferative effects in a0vitro lately comparative observations were described for the combination of the pi3kÎ inhibitor puquitinib with arac in an aml xenograft model addition of a0idel to a0dex leads to a0enhanced anti proliferative effects in a0glucocorticoid sensitive and a0 resistant cellsthe addition of idel to dex resulted in an enhanced antiproliferative effect and higher apoptosis rates in glucocorticoid gcresistant and sensitive proball cell lines both cell lines are characterized by a translocation between chromosome hsa4 and hsa11 in general the presence of this translocation is associated with gcresistance and often observed in cases of relapses however only sem cells established from a 5yearsold girl at relapse show reduced sensitivity to dex while rs411 established from a 32yearold woman at relapse are considered as highly sensitive while in sem a0µm dex exposure inhibited the rate of proliferation to approx a half rs411 proliferation was found decreased to nearly by the 1000fold diluted concentration the addition of idel to dex led to a strongly dexsensitizing effect on both cell lines sem proliferation was further reduced to approx while rs411 proliferation was reduced to nearly additionally the observed apoptosis inducing effect of dex was found increased by the addition of idel in both cell linesakin to the effects observed for arac idel the addition of idel to dex induced specific pathways modulations and also induced exclusive gene expression influencing key regulators such as cell cycle and dnareplication thereby key mediato\nLabels:

administration of isotonic solutions and for continuous opioid and other infusion therapiesmedications eg immunoglobulin therapy subcutaneous access isachieved through the placement of a small catheter in the subcutaneous tissue with the infusate absorbed from this space into the circulatory system this route has the advantages ofrequiring a small catheter and less technical insertion skills than that used for intravenousaccess with its ease of application lending to its use in multiple settings additionallytime to place the catheter is less and fewer complications are likely resulting in cost benefits although practiced since there has been a slow uptake in part due to a lack offamiliarity with the technique among physicians and healthcare professionals and

infusion therapymaterial and methodswe adopted the systematic review of systematic reviews methodology from the joannabriggs institute s to conduct this review the study protocol was registered with theprospero database registration number crd42018046504 and we report the reviewaccording to the preferred reporting items for systematic review and metaanalysisprisma guidelines s1 table eligibility criteriawe considered all types of systematic reviews which included the following characteristics a clearly stated set of objectives with an explicit reproducible methodology a systematic search that attempts to identify all studies that would meet the eligibilitycriteria an assessment of the validity of the findings of the included studies eg assessment of riskof bias and confidence in cumulative estimates and systematic presentation and synthesis of the characteristics and findings of the includedstudies metaanalyses where some of the primary studies in the reviews were duplicated we did not exclude thereviews as they had different aims and objectives and thus added to the overall understandingof sci to meet the aims of this current systematic review we did however only include the primary studies findings once in our analysis and synthesis expert opinionconsensus andbench research s and editorialscorrespondence were excluded no restrictionsregarding age gender diagnosis geographical location or healthcare setting were appliedwe included reviews that assessed interventions that used subcutaneous infusion for aduration of around hours or more as an alternate route for fluid or medication therapy subcutaneous infusion is defined as the delivery of fluids or medication into the subcutaneousspace for absorption into the circulation via perfusion diffusion balance

natriuretic peptide systems in covid patients additionally the use of arni is also recom mended for patients suffering from covid19 all these ï nd ings highlighted the need for designing novel nep inhibitors but de novo drug development is resource intensive and time consum ing hence drug discovery by repurposing the existing drugs can be an attractive strategy with the beneï t of reduced developmen tal risk especially in the case of nep inhibitors the computation repurposing is known as insilico drug re purposing in in the us approximately of drugs ap proved was through the drug repurposing approach the con cept of drug repurposing has been already practiced in cardio vascular disorders cancer obesity erectile dysfunction smoking cessation stress psychosis etc drug repurposing using al ready approved drugs reduces the time and money on preliminary screening toxicity studies clinical trials bulk manufacturing and formulation development on the other hand the establishment of new drug candidates requires lots of time and resources a good example is the case of allopurinol which was originally approved for cancer and is now available for the treatment of gout in this context we decided to identify a series of inhibitors for nep using insilico drug repurposing the protein structure of the extracellular domain of nep with sacubitralat the active metabo lite of sacubitril was used in the current study the inhibitor bind ing pocket in the protein structure of the extracellular domain of human nep pdb id 5jmy has already been revealed by schier ing nikolaus the inhibitor binding pocket contains the catalytically essential triad of his583 his587 and glu646 for our drug repurposing study the structures of fda approved drugs were downloaded from the zinc database based on the binding pocket of the nep inhibitor the high throughput virtual screening of existing fda approved drugs was done to ï nd out a new se ries of nep inhibitors to the best of our knowledge this is the ï rst study based on drug repurposing approach that is being re ported and employed for the development of nep inhibitors using receptorinhibitor complex materials and methods in the current study the maestro molecular platform version by schrodinger llc was used to perform molecular dock ing and simulation studies on an hp desktop system with linux ubuntu lts platform intel haswell graphics card 8gb ram and intel core i34160 processor protein preparation and grid generation xray crystallographic structure of the extracellular domain of human nep pdb id 5jmy was downloaded from the rcsb pro tein data bank the pdb id 5jmy has a resolution of Ë a prior to docking and simulation studies the biological unit of protein was prepared using protein preparation wizard in schrodinger suite during the process of protein preparation the protein was subjected to import and reï ne review and modify and minimize processes in protein preparation wizard missing side chains and residues were ï lled using the prime tool the active site and cat alytically important residues were retained in the protein structure the water molecules beyond Ë a were deleted and stages were generated for hetero atoms to generate low energy state protein energy minimization was done using opls3e optimized potential for liquid stimulation force ï eld and the prepared protein was used for molecular modelling to generate a grid around the lig and the receptor grid generation workï ow was used by keeping all functional residues in the grid ligand preparation the structures of fda approved drugs from zinc database were downloaded for ligand preparation the lig prep tool was employed the lowest energy 3d structures with cor under the opls3e related chiralities were generated at ph force ï eld in this process all the ligands were preprocessed which includes generation of tautomers ionization state at ph using epik addition of hydrogen bond charged group neu tralization and ligand geometry were optimized ligand docking all the molecular docking studies were carried out using the ligand docking tool glide gridbased ligand docking with ener getics module the glide module was used for predicting ligand protein binding modes and ranking different scoring functions are involved in glide such as highthroughput virtual screening htvs standard precision sp and extra precision xp first all the drugs were docked with htvs mode but computationally htvs docking does not use descriptor and explicit water technol ogy as used in the xp mode hence to avoid falsepositive results few drugs were reanalyzed using sp and xp modes free ligand binding energy calculation the prime module was used to determine absolute ligand binding aï nities to nep using mmgbsa molecular mechanics energies generalized born and surface area continuum solvation method the mmgbsa assay of top eight xp docked drugs was performed using pose viewer ï le of glide xp mode the prime mmgbsa method is dependent on the vsgb solvation model that uses a variabledielectric generalized born model and water as a solvent under the opls3e force ï eld to calculate

molecular dynamics md simulation the ï exibility of the receptor is restricted in gridbased dock ing systems like xp and ifd these do not mimic the actual bio logical systems where the protein and

20ns for md simulation three steps were performed viz system builder mini mization and md simulation the docked complex of protein and ligand were selected and the system model was made by prede ï ned

free binding energy and adme analysis results nep was prepared at a neutral ph of Î helical Î subdomains were present in the extracellular domain both helical subdomains of nep are connected with the linker region two and essential catalytic triad are present in the central cavity of both subdomains in the central cavity the catalytically impor tant zinc atom is coordinated with the side chains of amino acid residues his583 his587 and glu646 in the protein the cocrystallized ligand sacubitrilat is bound to the active site of nep and showed crucial interactions with his583 his587 and glu646 residues a fourth interaction was provided by the car boxylate oxygen adjacent to the p1 methyl group of sacubitri lat to generate a receptor grid receptor grid generation workï ow was used and the cubic box of speciï c dimensions was generated around sacubitrilat to perform molecular docking studies ligand docking around ligands from zinc database were screened with htvs docking mode of glide panel htvs docking mode utilizes a small period to a large set of drugs by reducing the ï nal torsional reï nement and comprehensive sampling but during htvs dock ing mode the number of intermediate conformational sampling is limited hence a total of drugs with dock scores less than kcalmole were ï ltered and reanalyzed in sp docking mode after performing sp docking around drugs were subjected to an extensive xp docking mode of glide panel xp docking mode is more accurate avoids the possibility of falsepositive results and gives an appropriate correlation between a good pose of drugs and a

nikolaus et al had reported that the hydropho bic interaction of sacubitrilat with phe544 was towards the shal low s1 pocket of nep protein the charge positive interac tion with arg717 and polar interaction with asn542 were found to be common in sacubitrilat and selected eight drugs even in this study all the eight drugs showed hydrophobic interactions with phe544 sacubitrilat also showed interactions with asn542 arg717 arg110 and arg102 our eight selected drugs showed in teractions with atleast two of the aforementioned residues insilico docking studies also showed that all the eight drugs showed in teraction with his711 which then formed a hydrogen bond with zinc causing the stabilization of zinc transition state this in teraction with zinc and its stabilization might result in decreased catalytic activity of nep as it is a zinc dependent endopeptidase nep degrades various peptide substrates at the amino sides of hydrophobic amino acids according to the reports the pro tein

and the selected eight drugs showed polar pipi stacking and cation interaction with his583 the interactions with side chains of ala543 ile558 phe563 met579 val580 his583 val692 and trp693 may con tribute to inhibition of the peptidase activity of nep according to previous reports amino acid residue glu584 is important for peptidase activity and residues such as ala543 and asn542 are important for nep inhibition in the current study all eight selected drugs possess interaction with glu584 asn542 and ala543 the 2d interaction diagrams with a summary of all non bonding interactions are given

interac tion and binding energy of the eight drugs four ligands showing good values were taken forward for induced ï t docking ifd in virtual docking protocol the interactions occur between the bind ing site of the rigid protein and the ï exible ligand but this is not the case with the actual ligandprotein interactions in the body where the target protein undergoes backbone or sidechain move ments after binding with ligands this induces alteration in binding sites of the protein also in the body the ligand binding site on the proteins conforms to the ligand shape and binding mode ifd was conducted to resolve the shortcomings of rigid docking pro tocols ifd has two main applications ï rst it generates the most accurate active complex structure of ligand which is not possi ble in virtual molecular docking with rigid protein structure sec ond ifd avoids falsenegative results of virtual docking in virtual docking screening of the ligands was done with the single confor mation of ligands however in ifd conï rmers were generated for each ligand hence ifdsp was carried for zinc0 zinc0 zinc0 and zinc0 and a maximum of conformers were generated for each ligand based on molecular

the selected drugs obey the lip inski rule of ï ve molecular dynamics md simulation molecular dynamics is used to simulate ligandprotein com plexes in presence of systems with biological relevance it includes the explicit solvent representation with the entire protein the main advantage of md stimulation is that it represents the actual conditions of the biological system it provides a highly dynamic protein structure and the ligandprotein complex is solvated with water as happens in the biological system ifd however pro vides limited ï exibility which is insuï cient to mimic the actual conditions of a biological system hence md simulation studies were carried out to get insights into the top four drugs in terms of binding stability and nonbonding interactions with crucial amino acid within the drugbinding pocket of nep protein in a dynamic state in md simulation the frame was captured for 20ps which results in the generation of frames for 20ns stimulation time and saved in a

{"system": "You are a medical text classifier. Choose exactly one label.", "user": "Text: We retrospectively reviewed 91 patients with stage III NSCLC treated with definitive chemoradiation. All patients underwent a pretreatment diagnostic contrast enhanced CT (CE-CT) followed by a 4D-CT for treatment simulation. We used the average (average-CT) and expiratory (T50-CT) images from the 4D-CT along with the CE-CT for texture extraction. Histogram gradient co-occurrence gray-tone difference and filtration-based techniques were used for texture feature extraction. Penalized Cox regression implementing cross-validation was used for covariate selection and modeling. Models incorporating texture features from the 3 image types and CPFs were compared to models incorporating CPFs alone for overall survival (OS) local-regional control (LRC) and freedom from distant metastases (FFDM). Predictive Kaplan-Meier curves were generated using leave-one-out cross-validation. Patients were stratified based on their predicted outcome being above below the median. Reproducibility of texture features was evaluated using test-retest scans from independent patients and quantified using concordance correlation coefficients (CCC). We compared models incorporating the reproducibility seen on test-retest scans to our original models and determined the classification reproducibility. Results Models incorporating both texture features and CPFs demonstrated a significant improvement in risk stratification compared to models using CPFs alone for OS (p 0.046) LRC (p 0.01) and FFDM (p 0.005). The average CCC was 0.890.91 and 0.67 for texture features extracted from the average-CT T50-CT and CE-CT respectively. Incorporating reproducibility within our models yielded 80.4 (SD 3.7) 78.3 (SD 4.0) and 78.8 (SD 3.9) percent classification reproducibility in terms of OS LRC and FFDM respectively. Conclusions Pretreatment tumor texture may provide prognostic information beyond what is obtained from CPFs. Models incorporating feature reproducibility achieved classification rates of 80 . External validation would be required to establish texture as a prognostic factor.

Published by the British Institute of Radiology 2014 The British Institute of Radiology Objective: This meta-analysis is to determine the overall diagnostic yield of CT-guided transthoracic needle biopsy (TNB) of ground-glass opacity (GGO) lesions. Methods: A PubMed search was performed using ground-glass opacity crossed with core biopsy and needle biopsy . Test performance characteristics with the use of forest plots summary receiver operating characteristic curves and bivariate random effects models were summarized. Adverse events if reported were recorded. Results: Our search identified 52 citations of which 6 diagnostic studies evaluated 341 patients. Pooled specificity estimates were 0.94 95 confidence interval (CI) 0.84 0.98 and sensitivity estimates were 0.92 (95 CI 0.88 0.95) respectively. The positive likelihood ratio was 11.27 (95 CI 4.2 30.6) the negative likelihood ratio was 0.1 (95 CI 0.06 0.19) the diagnostic odds ratio was 131.38 (95 CI 39.6 436.0) and the area under the curve was 0.97. Conclusion: Our data suggest that the CT-guided TNB is likely to be a useful tool for tissue diagnosis and may serve as an alternative for further patient management with GGO lesions. However considering the limited studies and patients included large scale studies are needed to verify these findings.

Background and Objectives. The aim of this study was to investigate inflammatory indicators and oxidative status in patients with asbestos exposure with and without mesothelioma and to compare results with data from healthy subjects. Methods. Eighty people with exposure to environmental asbestos and without any disease 46 mesothelioma patients and a control group of 50 people without exposure to environmental asbestos were enrolled in this prospective study. Serum total oxidant level (TOL) total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and oxidative stress index (OSI) CRP transferrin ceruloplasmin ?-1 antitrypsin ferritin and copper levels were measured. Results. Mesothelioma group exhibited higher TOL OSI ?1-antitrypsin ferritin and copper levels as compared to the other groups (P 0.001 P 0.007 P 0.0001 P 0.001 and P 0.001 resp.). Transferrin was lower in the mesothelioma group than in the other two groups (P 0.001). The asbestos group had higher TOL TAC ?1-antitrypsin and transferrin levels (P 0.001 P 0.001 P 0.001 and P 0.001 resp.) as well as lower OSI and ferritin levels as compared to the control group (P 0.001 and P 0.001). Conclusions. We believe that elevated acute phase reactants and oxidative stress markers (TOL and OSI) in the mesothelioma group can be used as predictive markers for the development of asbestos-related malignancy. 1. Introduction Asbestos causes pulmonary fibrosis pleural diseases and malignancies. However the pathogenesis of asbestos-related diseases has not been clearly shown 1 . Recent studies indicate that increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) caused by asbestos plays an important role in this pathogenesis 2 . Oxidative stress occurs as a result of the failure to neutralize ROS with enzymatic and nonenzymatic systems 3 . Elevated levels of ROS lead to cell damage through peroxidation of double-chain fatty acids protein and DNA 4 . Moreover ROS have been shown to cause apoptosis inflammation and proliferation 5 . Previous studies have shown that exposure to asbestos leads to oxidative stress by revealing reduced levels of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase catalase glutathione peroxidase and heme oxygenase 2 6 . However individual values of these enzymes may not correctly reflect total oxidant or total antioxidant status. Erel developed a new automated and colorimetric measurement method for total oxidant level (TOL) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) while the ratio of these two parameters (TOL TAC) is used for the calculation of oxidative stree index (OSI) which in turn allows the assessment of balance between ROS and antioxidant systems 7 . To our knowledge there is not any study evaluating oxidative stress in malignant mesothelioma (MM) and asbestos exposure in such detail in the literature. Chronic inflammation induced by different biologic and chemical factors has been shown to be a significant predisposing factor in the development of various an cancers 8 . For example chronic inflammatory bowel disease is a predisposing factor of colon cancer chronic B and C hepatitis are predisposing factors of hepatocellular carcinoma and chronic gastritis induced by Helicobacter pylori is a predisposing factor of gastric cancer 9 11 . Similarly there are studies investigating the link between chronic inflammation associated with long-term asbestos exposure and mesothelioma 12 13 . Authors claim that chronic inflammation triggered by asbestos exposure leads to increased production of ROS from inflammatory cells or alteration of immunocompetent cells and later reduction of tumor immunity 14 15 .\nLabels: [Thyroid_Cancer, Colon_Cancer, Lung_Cancer]\nReply with one label only.", "assistant": "Lung_Cancer"}

{"system": "You are a medical text classifier. Choose exactly one label.", "user": "Text: Twelve studies of various design reported statistically significant association between ICC and survival. General surgeons were surveyed to identify individual and anizational barriers to MCC adoption 22 . Surgeons said that MCCs were not well supported institutionally or widely accessible few had a designated coordinator and most reviewed only rare or select cases rather than all new cancer patients. Interviews and observation were used to explore MCC use in four hospitals 23 . Thirty-seven MCCs were observed at three hospitals and 48 clinicians and administrators were interviewed. Institutions lacked the capacity to fully implement MCCs as part of routine practice. MJD developed a measure of cancer services integration and conducted a population-based survey of Ontario health professionals to evaluate integration. The study identified 12 factors that accounted for the majority of variation in cancer services integration 24 . This work emphasized how leadership coordination resource allocation and communication influence overall integration of cancer services. Further analysis of this data revealed variability in access to electronic health records (EHRs) across different provider groups anization types and geographic locations which may limit ICC 25 . Another analysis focused specifically on the benefits of MCCs as a model of ICC 26 . Overall 74 of respondents were aware of MCCs within their region but only 58 were regular participants. Diagnostic assessment programs MCCs represent one model of ICC for treatment decision making. The time interval from suspicion to diagnosis of cancer involves numerous consultations and testing and is a confusing time for patients. Timely diagnosis can lead to improved access to MCCs or other consultation earlier treatment and a better prognosis 1-21 . Clinicians and managers suggested the need to improve ICC earlier in the cancer trajectory given barriers of access to and coordination of diagnosis and staging and recommended centralized diagnostic facilities 14-19 . An expert panel assembled by the provincial cancer agency issued anizational standards for Diagnostic Assessment Programs (DAPs) to coordinate diagnostic tests and integrate multidisciplinary expertise 2728 . A summary of recommended DAP features appears in . DAP standards Component Description Team composition Administrative Director manager Reception clerical and bookings Health professionals Assessment coordinators (examples): Radiologists Pathologists Primary care Psychosocial support Specialists Surgeon specialists Respirologists (lung) Endoscopists (colorectal and other) Technicians Ultrasound technologists Mammographers (breast) Scope of diagnostic activity Examination (diagnostic activity differs depending on disease site) Physical exam Other disease site specific Imaging diagnostic and staging procedures Ultrasound MRI X-ray CT scan PET Upper endoscopy Colonoscopy Bronchoscopy Cystoscopy Bone scan Mammography Other disease site specific Surgical consultation and procedures Biopsy Fine needle aspiration cytology Biopsy Pathology and laboratory medicine Standardized surgical pathology requisition forms Routine analysis and pathology reporting Special pathological studies such as markers flow molecular etc Clinical lab testing of tumour markers hematology etc. Supportive care Education psychosocial support Dietetics Genetic counselling Other supportive services Access Regionalized centralized One stop Virtual Entry point Primary care providers or specialist Screening program Self referral Operational features Entry Fast access booking Priority booking Open-access booking DAP core elements Assessment coordinator Multidisciplinary care conference (MCC) team treatment team Cross-DAP collaboration Provincial indicators of quality for cancer DAPs Time intervals Clinical outcomes Quality of care Patient satisfaction Guidelines standards and services frameworks Guidelines and service frameworks for primary care providers Evidence-based investigative algorithms and guidance documents Wait-times benchmarks Study rationale ICC for cancer leads to multiple system anizational professional and patient benefits. However our analysis of conceptual literature did not reveal optimal ways to achieve ICC and our review of empirical literature revealed that no interventions apart from MCCs have been used to promote ICC for cancer care. Our research with health professionals identified limited support for use of and access to interventions that enable ICC for cancer particularly outside of designated cancer hospitals in community settings where the majority of cancer care takes place and for cancer diagnosis. DAPs appear to be a promising model by which to enable ICC. In 2007 the provincial cancer agency funded four pilot DAPs and all achieved reductions in wait times (http: www.cancercare.on.ca pcs diagnosis diagprograms ). Hospital one reduced median time from suspicion of breast cancer to biopsy by 60 (38 to 15 days) and from suspicion to diagnosis by 53 (42 to 20 days); hospital two reduced time from referral to colonoscopy for patients with positive fecal occult blood test results by 78 ; hospital three reduced lung cancer wait times from 113 to 69 days for referral to diagnosis; and hospital four reduced lung cancer wait times from 120 to 44 days for suspicion to diagnosis. Wait times are only one possible outcome of ICC. We require more information about how to design and implement DAPs to optimize ICC and achieve the range of associated beneficial outcomes. We conducted a systematic review of the cancer literature to describe clinical and economic evaluations of DAPs 29 . Most of the 20 eligible studies did not base their evaluations on guideline recommendations or quality indicators or include economic evaluations. Several DAPs were implemented across Ontario so more comprehensive evaluation was warranted and possible to better understand how various DAP models enabled ICC. The purpose of this study is to: 1. Describe DAP structure function and outcomes according to published DAP standards clinical guideline recommendations and a theoretical framework of ICC. 2. Conduct a pilot costing analysis of delivering diagnostic services with DAPs. 3. Explore challenges of DAP implementation and operation and associated ICC. 4. Issue recommendations that may optimize the implementation operation and outcomes of DAPs. This research will not evaluate DAPs from the perspective of patients. While crucial that objective warrants separate multi-year investigation to explore patient preferences for diagnostic care first through review of the literature then by interviewing patients with various characteristics who did and did not experience DAP care. This would establish patient-informed performance measures of diagnostic services and ICC which do not exist. We found that patient views about cancer care performance measures differed from those of health professionals thus development of patient-informed performance measures is necessary to fully evaluate the services provided by DAPs and the degree to which the DAP model enables ICC 30 . Instead this proposal responds to the expressed needs of our research partners and for multiple reasons including feasibility focuses first on evaluating DAPs according to evidence-based standards for DAPs and clinical care delivery and by soliciting the views of involved health professionals. This preliminary evaluation is needed to establish a baseline understanding of how DAPs were implemented and function. Only then will we have sufficient insight on factors influencing DAP outcomes that we could ask patients about and an established relationship with DAP collaborators to enable an expanded research study that would include patient recruitment. Methods Design A case study approach was chosen to explore multiple factors that influence ICC including DAP structure processes and outcomes 31 . These will be assessed according to DAP standards and guideline recommendations for staging and diagnosis of breast 32-34 and lung cancer 2728 . This will enable comparison between cases (DAPs) that vary by type of cancer academic status and geographic region. This may identify whether and how differences in DAP leadership staffing resources and referral patterns influence ICC or whether ICC must be enabled differently by condition. This approach is suitable for examining complex issues that require holistic interpretation ( triangulation ) of data collected in a variety of ways from different sources. Data will be collected from medical records and interviews. Four hospitals from different regions of Ontario agreed to participate. Two are considered academic teaching hospitals. Each site features a breast DAP and a lung DAP for a total of eight participating DAPs. This study was reviewed and approved by the University Health Network Research Ethics Board and research ethics boards at each of the four participating hospitals. Conceptual framework The overall goal of this study is to explore how DAPs enable ICC and associated outcomes. ICC was defined as interaction among various types of health professionals to plan or evaluate services or plan provide or review results or outcomes for individual patients . There is no single existing model or theory that describes factors influencing the quality of ICC so we compiled a conceptual framework from several sources. We had reviewed several bodies of knowledge describing models of health professional interaction for patient management according to the concepts of teamwork inter-professional collaboration continuity of care integrated service delivery inter-anizational collaboration and case management and extracted data on common domains and elements and associated outcomes 20 . This generated core components and enablers of ICC that were common across the models. anizational standards for DAPs that are described in 2728 were mapped onto this preliminary framework. The conceptual framework was expanded by adding challenges 10-26 and beneficial outcomes 9-21 identified in our background review of the literature. We also reviewed clinical guidelines for breast 32-34 and lung cancer 2728 to incorporate elements of desirable care delivery and outcomes. The resulting conceptual framework (Figure 1) will be used to inform the development of data collection instruments and data analysis. Findings will be used to validate and extend the conceptual framework to describe how DAP structure function and support enable ICC and associated outcomes. Figure 1 Conceptual framework describing factors that influence how DAPs achieve ICC and associated benefits. Medical record review to describe DAP services and outcomes Approach To describe DAP function and outcomes and gather information that will enable costing recommendations expressed in DAP standards and clinical guidelines will be assessed through retrospective observational study. Data will be acquired from databases maintained by participating DAPs and the provincial cancer agency and confirmed by and supplemented with review of medical records. Sampling Eligible patients include those 18 years of age or older with suspected lung or breast cancer who were referred to participating DAPs between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2012. Based on input from collaborating sites we initially estimated that this includes a mean of 15 new patients per month by two types of cancer in four sites for an annual total of 360 patients per site and an overall total of 1440 patients. Assuming a type I error (alpha) rate of 0.05 power of 0.80 and equal sample sizes for two comparative groups (i.e. academic community status or breast lung cancer) 170 patients (85 in each group) in total would be required to detect a statistically significant difference in compliance with a given DAP or clinical guideline standard of 15 . Thus estimated patient sampling is more than sufficient to identify variations in process or outcome performance measures according to varying DAP features. However DAPs vary in case volume. To give equal weight to each DAP at each participating site based on patient volume 15 of patients will be randomly sampled from among those newly referred during the given time period. For all sites this is equal to or greater than minimal sample sizes estimated by traditional power calculation. Data collection and analysis Data reflecting DAP and guideline recommendations for diagnostic activity () will be extracted from medical records. A trained data abstractor will visit participating sites. Before this a data extraction form will be developed and independently pilot tested on five cases by two individuals. They will compare congruence of extracted data to assess how the form should be revised. This will be repeated until the format and content of the data extraction form is satisfactory and congruence of independently extracted data is high. During chart review 5 of charts will be re-abstracted for data quality monitoring. Summary statistics will be used to report compliance with DAP and guideline standards for patients overall and by DAP academic status and type of cancer. Statistical significance of differing outcomes will be reported with the Pearson s chi-square test. A generalized linear mixed model approach will be used to address binary and continuous process and outcome variables. Hierarchical modeling (patient level one hospital level two) will be used to allow for clustering by hospital. Pilot costing analysis of DAP diagnostic visits and services Approach Our ultimate goal is to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) but this is a complex undertaking requiring considerable data on the actual number and nature of services provided per patient and their cost. The purpose of CEA is not hypothesis testing but rather it is estimation 35 . To do a CEA one needs to compute estimates of the extra cost (?C) and the extra effect (?E) of an intervention. The ratio of ?C to ?E is called the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and is the main statistic in CEA. Such data are not readily available in administrative databases and often requires primary data collection from medical records. We currently do not know whether data required for a CEA of DAPs is available in medical records.\nLabels: [Thyroid_Cancer, Colon_Cancer, Lung_Cancer]\nReply with one label only.", "assistant": "Lung_Cancer"}
{"system": "You are a medical text classifier. Choose exactly one label.", "user": "Text: As one of the DNA repair genes ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene which is responsible for the multisystem autoxomal recessive disorder ataxia-telangiectasia (A T) plays a crucial role in the recognition signaling and repair of DNA damage especially DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) 4 5 . The ATM protein is a member of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI-3 kinases) and can be activated by DSBs caused by ionizing radiation or reactive oxygen intermediates 6 7 . Once activated ATM can phosphorylate various downstream substates that function in cell cycle arrest apoptosis and DNA repair such as p53 NBS1 BRCA1 and Chk2 8 9 . Therefore genetic variants in ATM gene may lead to the structure and function change of the protein and act as important factors indicating individual susceptibility to cancer. ATM -111G A (rs189037) resides in the promoter of ATM gene. Increasing studies have shown that variations in the DNA promoter sequence may potentially alter the affinities of multiple regulatory proteins-DNA interactions or the specificity of the transcriptional process 10 13 . Although this polymorphism makes no amino acid change the alleles may have different binding affinity to the transcription factor and exhibit different levels of mRNA expression 14 15 . Zhang et al. 16 declared that ATM rs189037 AA genotype was associated with a lower ATM mRNA levels than GG genotype in lung tissue samples. Their results showed that the G-to-A change might create a transcriptional inhibitor-binding site for ATM rs189037 A allele promoter and subsequently reduce the ATM mRNA expression. Consequently lower expression of ATM might cause elevated sensitivity to ionizing radiation defects in the activation of cell cycle checkpoints a reduced capacity for DNA repair and abnormal apoptosis. All of these features would contribute to increased individual cancer susceptibility. In recent years a number of studies have evaluated the association between this polymorphism and cancer risk such as thyroid carcinoma 17 oral cancer 18 breast cancer 19 leukemia 20 nasopharyngeal carcinoma 21 glioma 22 and lung caner 23 25 . Previous studies of ATM rs189037 have included cigarette smokers as cases and controls that made it difficult to judge whether this polymorphism were associated with lung cancer or tobacco use. Considering the facts in China the incidence and death rate of lung cancer in women continues to increase and this phenomenon is frequently occurring in those who have never smoked. In order to have a better control of confounding of gender or smoking we performed a case-control study to identify the association between the polymorphism of ATM rs189037 and the risk of lung cancer in the non-smoking females in Chinese Han population. We also investigated the interaction between genetic polymorphism and environmental exposure in lung cancer. Methods Subjects This hospital-based case-control study included 487 lung cancer patients and 516 cancer-free hospital controls. All subjects were female non-smokers and they were from unrelated ethic Han Chinese. The cases were recruited during January 2002 to November 2012 at Liaoning Cancer Hospital Institute. All patients were histologically confirmed to have lung cancer before any radiotherapy and chemotherapy. During the same time controls were selected from patients with other lung diseases but free of cancer history and symptom. Controls suffered mainly from bronchitis pneumonias fibrosis sarcoidosis chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and emphysema. Controls were all non-smoking females and frequency-matched to case subjects for age ( 5 years). This study was approved by the institutional review board of China Medical University and written informed consent was obtained from each participant or each participant's representatives if direct consent could not be obtained. Data Collection A total of 10 ml of venous blood was collected from each patient. Patients were interviewed to collect information for demographics and environmental exposure at the time they were admitted to hospital. Information concerning demographic characteristics passive smoking cooking oil fume exposure fuel smoke exposure family history of cancer occupational exposure and dietary habit was obtained for each case and control by trained interviewers. An individual was defined as a smoker if she had consumed a total of 100 cigarettes in her lifetime; otherwise she was considered as a non-smoker. About fuel smoke exposure participants who used coal-fuel-burning stoves without chimneys were regarded as fuel smoke exposure. For exposure to cooking oil fumes participants were mainly asked about the method of cooking and eyes or throat irritation. For cooking methods participants were asked whether they cooked food in a stir-frying way and how many times a week; for eyes or throat irritation participants were asked how often they felt eyes or throat irritated by the oily smoke. There were four possible responses ranging from never seldom sometimes and frequently . Subjects were considered as cooking oil fume exposure if they met criteria as follows: (1) have cooked for over 15 years; (2) cooked food in a stir-frying way for more than twice a week; (3) felt eyes or throat irritated by oily smoke. Exposure for cooking oil fume was categorized as an indicator variable equal to 1 if participants reported frequently or sometimes and equal to 0 otherwise. Genotype Analysis Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples by the conventional phenol-chloroform extraction method. SNP was genotyped by investigators blinded to case-control status in order to avoid any genotyping bias using TaqMan methodology and read with the Sequence Detection Software on an Applied Biosystems 7500 FAST Real-Time PCR System according to the manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems Foster City CA). Amplification was done under the following conditions: 95 C for 10 min followed by 47 cycles of 92 C for 30 s and 60 C for 1 min. In this study 487 lung cancer patients and 516 controls were all genotyped successfully and 5 duplicated samples were randomly selected to assess the reproducibility for quality control with a concordance rate of 100 . Statistical Analysis The x2 test and t test were applied to estimate differences in demographic variables and distributions of genotypes between cases and controls. The association of genotypes of ATM rs189037 with risk of lung cancer was estimated by computing the odds ratios (ORs) and 95 confidence intervals (CIs) in unconditional logistic regression analysis. The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) was tested using goodness-fit x2 test to compare the genotype frequencies in the control subjects from those expected. A logistic regression model was used to evaluate gene-environment interactions. All data were analyzed with Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS) v13.0 for Windows if not otherwise specified. All statistical analysis were two-sided and the significance level was set at P 0.05. Results Population characteristics A total of 487 lung cancer and 516 age-matched cancer-free controls were enrolled in this study. As shown in the mean ages of cases and controls (mean S.D.) were almost identical (56.5 11.7 and 56.3 12.5 respectively). All cases were female non-smoking lung cancer patients. No statistically significant difference was found between cases and controls in terms of age (P? ?0.248) and monthly income (P? ?0.084). Cases included 434 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients and 53 small cell carcinoma patients. In the NSCLC cases there were 320 adenocarcinomas 73 squamous cell carcinomas and 41 other tumors with a variety of different pathologies (such as large cell carcinomas mixed cell carcinomas or undifferentiated carcinomas). .0096911.t001 Characteristics of lung cancer cases and controls.

Association analysis The observed genotype frequencies among the control subjects was in agreement with that expected under the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P? ?0.119). The distribution of ATM rs189037 genotypes among subjects were displayed in Table 2. Using subjects with the ATM rs189037 GG genotype as the reference group we calculated the ORs and 95 CIs for heterozygous carriers of GA genotype and homozygous carriers of AA genotype. No significant difference was observed between lung cancer cases and controls in each test (P 0.05). In order to increase the statistical power we combined the GA genotype with the AA genotype to compare with GG genotype as a dominant model and combined the GA genotype with the GG genotype to compare with AA genotype as a recessive model. The results indicated that individuals with AA genotype had a significantly elevated risk of lung adenocarcinoma compared with those carrying the GG or GA genotype (OR? ?1.44 95 CI 1.02 2.02 P? ?0.039). .0096911.t002 Table 2 Distribution of ATM rs189037 genotypes and ORs for lung cancer cases and controls.

According to the results above we assumed that ATM rs189037 AA genotype might affect lung adenocarcinoma risk among non-smoking Chinese females. To test this hypothesis and explore the gene-environment interaction we adopted all the lung adenocarcinoma patients and cancer-free controls whose information about environmental risk factors were completely obtained such as fuel smoke exposure cooking oil fume exposure passive smoking and family history of cancer. Cases and controls were not included in the association analysis if any item of their environmental risk factors data was incomplete. After screening we had 242 lung adenocarcinoma cases and 277 cancer-free controls that were eligible. Selected demographic variables and environmental risk factors for the cases and controls were listed in Table 3.\nLabels: [Thyroid_Cancer, Colon_Cancer, Lung_Cancer]\nReply with one label only.", "assistant": "Lung_Cancer"}
