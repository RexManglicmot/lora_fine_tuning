    "text": "Phenothiazines elicit caspase-mediated and caspase-independent cell death To gain insight into the mechanistic basis of phenothiazine-associated cytotoxicity we analyzed in detail the mode by which these compounds induce cell death in human SCLC cells. While some studies have implicated apoptosis as a major cell death mode in phenothiazine-treated cells34 9 we found that the percentage of SCLC exhibiting nuclear morphologic changes typical of apoptosis such as chromatin condensation and fragmentation remained low (10 ) even at the highest TFP concentrations where 98 of all cells lost the ability to exclude propidium iodide (PI; data not shown). Instead TFP-treated SCLC cells exhibited profoundly shrunken nuclei without concomitant chromatin condensation. TFP elicited poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage in some but not all LC cell lines (Figures 3a and b). Importantly although the SCLC cells are sensitive to 10??M TFP treatment and respond with an approximately 60 decrease in cell viability this concentration of TFP only resulted in no or minor cleavage of PARP. Consistent with a non-essential requirement of caspase-mediated apoptotic response the pan-caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp fluoromethylketone (z-VAD-fmk) did not significantly protect either SCLC (H82) or NSCLC (U-1810) cells from TFP-induced cell death (c) emphasizing the involvement of non-caspase-mediated cell death in response to phenothiazines in SCLC. Phenothiazines induce lysosomal dysfunction in LC cells Phenothiazines are known to be lysosomotropic and accumulate within intracellular acidic compartments.12 13 We therefore examined whether phenothiazines may affect lysosomal functions in LC cells. We found that treatment with TFP and related phenothiazines (cis-flupenthixol dihydrochloride (cis-FPX) PZ chlorpromazine hydrochloride (CPZ) TFPZ and FPZ) caused a rapid increase in appearance of light chain 3 (LC3)-II a marker of autophagy in a dose- and time-dependent manner in both SCLC and NSCLC cells (Figures 4a c). By contrast the level of p62 SQSTM1 a scaffold protein that target ubiquitinated polypeptide cargo for autophagic degradation did not show any consistent change in response to TFP in the examined SCLC and NSCLC cells (a). As accumulation of LC3-II can result from either increased autophagic flux or impaired autophagic degradation we used chemical probes to manipulate these two processes separately and then investigated the effect of phenothiazines on LC3 conversion. Notably blocking autophagic degradation with the lysosomal protease inhibitor E-64d in cells treated with survivable concentrations of TFP (5??M in H82 and 10??M in U-1810) caused further accumulation of LC3-II indicative of enhanced autophagic flux (d). Similar results were obtained at cytotoxic concentrations of TFP or when autophagosome maturation was suppressed by bafilomycin A1 (BafA1; data not shown). Under conditions where de novo protein synthesis was shut down by cycloheximide (CHX) LC3-II induced by TFP pre-treatment (0 24?h) was rapidly cleared upon removal of TFP (e compare lanes 2 and 4). This process became significantly slower if TFP was present during the recovery period (24 48?h) especially in H82 cells (e compare lanes 5 and 6) suggesting that phenothiazines may additionally antagonize autophagic degradation. These data show that TFP both induces LC3-II and prevents its clearance especially in the SCLC cells which is consistent with the notion that phenothiazines perturb lysosome homeostasis more severely and persistently in SCLC than in NSCLC. Overall these data demonstrate that phenothiazines can modulate lysosomal functions in human LC cells. Basal lysosomal mass and pH buffer capacity can predict sensitivity to phenothiazines The response to chemotherapy (CT) in human tumors is highly heterogenous and therefore there is an urgent need for the identification of biomarkers for prediction of treatment efficacy. As our data suggest that the lysosome is a potentially critical site of action for phenothiazines when used as single treatment of LC cells we therefore sought to determine whether lysosome-associated parameters could be used to predict sensitivity of human LC cells to phenothiazines. Indeed we found a statistically significant inverse correlation between the mean cytotoxicity index calculated from the average cytotoxicity of six phenothiazines at 10??M (a ) and cellular retention of LysoTracker at baseline (a). On the other hand neither basal lysosomal ?-galactosidase (?-gal) activity nor the baseline expression levels of the lysosomal markers LC3-II and lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP-1) correlated well with cellular phenothiazine sensitivity (Supplementary Figures S2A C).",

humans and mice are that the baseline immunetone of the lungs even in health is closely linked to the local microbial milieu this hypothesis thatthe immune tone in the airways and alveoli is at least

understanding chronic lung disease berlin february the mucosal niche in the lungall external interfaces of the human body such as gut skin reproductive and respiratory tracts arecolonised by a distinct microbial flora the microbial communities differ at the various body sites dueto local factors eg oxygen carbon dioxide ph nutrients host defence factors inhaled pollutants thatshape the niche as examples the lumen of the lower gastrointestinal tract represents a lowoxygennutrientrich environment and is thus commonly populated by highabundance communities of anaerobicanisms by contrast the skin is a lownutrient environment directly exposed to environmental oxygenand is thus more commonly populated by relatively sparse communities of oxygentolerant bacteria thusthe local

respiratorytract and such local conditions are crucial for allowing beneficial microbiota to persist at epithelialsurfaces the involvement of such host microbiota interactions in disease is wellillustrated in cysticfibrosis in cystic fibrosis mutational dysfunction of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator cftrprotein results in a reduction of anion mostly bicarbonate and chloride exchange across the epithelialsurface resulting in a dehydrated surface and sticky mucus this mucus cannot be readily cleared from theairways which helps to explain why cftr mutations are associated

epithelium transmits environmental and microbial signals to the immune systemvarious mechanisms of sensing microbial presence include pattern recognition receptors such as thetolllike receptors and other processes not mediated via classical receptormediated signalling egthe integrated stress response upon sensing microbial environmental or endogenous challengesepithelial cells mount active responses by increasing defence molecules such as antimicrobial peptidescytokines and chemokines these enhance the defence against respiratory pathogens while simultaneouslychanging the ecological

0crespiratory basic science r gosens anatomical differences along the respiratory tract such as differences in epithelial cell composition shapethis ecological niche while the epithelium contributes to local conditions that shape the microbiotaepithelial exposure to microbes and their products has marked effects on its function consequentlyhuman epithelia and the microbiota have developed interactions that are of mutual benefit responding topathogens and tolerating innocuous substances this concept is important to understand how inhaledenvironmental triggers regulate immunity since microbial components contribute to the response toenvironmental exposures such as farm and geogenic earthderived dust however how theepithelium integrates these microbial and nonmicrobial signals into a finetuned response is incompletelyunderstoodin order to transmit signals from the environment epithelial cells use sophisticated communicationsystems with other lung cell types the airway epithelium

antiviral defences once established the composition of the lung microbiome is determined by three ecological factorsimmigration elimination and relative growth rates of community members figure in health lungcommunities are sparse and dynamic largely determined by the equilibrium between immigration viamicroaspiration and elimination via cough mucociliary clearance and immune defences littleevidence supports the presence of resident lung bacteria in health that reproduce and survive selectivepressures nevertheless the transient and dynamic communities detected in health are largelyviable and exert a detectable effect on the immune constitution of the lower respiratory tract the establishment of a diverse respiratory microbial flora is influenced by many different factors there isa finetuned balance between tolerance of commensal or beneficial bacteria at the epithelial surface andthe development of active immune responses to pathogens notably this balance is regulated by both hostand microbederived signals sudden shifts in this tightly controlled equilibrium such as outgrowth ofspecific pathogens or for example virally induced damage to the airway epithelium

of the environment in shaping the lung microbiomeenvironmental influences play pivotal roles in the development of lung diseases this might be due to directeffects on the host epithelial barrier and

microenvironment the lung microenvironment consists of different cell types depending onthe location in the proximaltodistal airway tree the epithelial layer in larger airways is constantly exposed to a variety of different microbes ofthe local microbiota while the composition of the latter is influenced by host factors such as elimination via mucociliary clearance it alsodepends on the competition among the microbial inhabitants it is now evident that there is a complex crosstalk between host and microbes inthis environment accordingly bacterial metabolites or outer membrane vesicles can influence the host status while antimicrobial peptides orcytokines can shape the composition of the microbiota as virtually all of these single factors are altered in chronic respiratory disease it is ofutmost importance to appreciate and assess the complexity of this system in future studiesepithelium in patients with copd it has been shown to be associated with reduced lung bacilli andincreased haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae but the largest study to date in healthy smokers has not found a significant effect of cigarette smoke on the lung microbiome thus it is intriguing to speculate that cigarette smoke primarily affects the host system which over timeand upon disease copd development in susceptible individuals may also affect the microbiomeanother example of environmental influence on respiratory disease is diet which has profound effects onboth microbiota and health even in the short term the intake of dietary fibre induces similarbeneficial microbiota changes in the lung and gut while lowfibre diets change the gut microbialcommunity over multiple generations in mice highfibre diets have beneficial effects in pregnant miceand suppress allergic

inflammation and has been associated with premetastatic nichedevelopment in lung cancer however the detailed mechanisms of action remain unclearalong with bacteria common major respiratory viruses including respiratory syncytial virus rhinoviruscoronaviruses influenza and adenoviruses are part of the respiratory microbiome and contribute tothe pathogenesis of chronic respiratory diseases this may result from complex interactions of viruses withthe host s immune system and the microbiota including other pathogens these interactions can influencethe prevalence of bacterial pathogens by increasing the expression of adhesion molecules on therespiratory epithelium damaging respiratory epithelial cells compromising barrier functionimpairingmucociliary clearance and altering host

pathogens on their own but also by activation of theimmuneinteractions with microbiota particularly withnontuberculous mycobacteria through theirsystemand probablyimportantly the absence of certain members from the microbiome can have detrimental influences on lunghealth this is illustrated by the relative disappearance of parasitic worms which have been a constant partof our gut microbiome and have even been found in fossils from the period of jawed fish in fact our10118313993003023202019 0crespiratory basic science r gosens modern immune system developed in the continuous presence of helminths which may explaintheir important regulatory role in immunity typically worms induce type2 immune responses which areconsidered instrumentalin host defence against these parasitic infections however worm infectionsinduce regulatory responses that are aimed to suppress immune responses directed at worm antigenswhich allows worms to live in their host for years additionally this regulatory response has a bystandereffect by promoting allergen tolerance this is illustrated by studies in mouse models in whichvarious helminth infections have been shown to provide protection against the development of allergicasthma the range of helminthinduced protective mechanisms includes the inhibition of interleukinil33 in the airways and the induction of regulatory tcells bcells andmacrophages intriguingly the presence of helminths also affects the composition of the bacterialcommunity which might be important for the protection against allergic airway disease in mice niche and microbiome alterations in respiratory diseasein disease the ecology of the lower respiratory tract changes dramatically the airways and alveolinormally inhospitable to bacterial reproduction are radically altered by the influx of nutrientrichoedema and mucus establishment of stark oxygen gradients surge of bacterial growthpromotinginflammatory responses and impairment of local host defences thus it is unsurprisingthat crosssectional studies have identified altered lung microbiomes in established lung diseases aschanges in ecological niches supposedly result in different microbial communities due to selective pressurethe composition of the lung microbiome then becomes increasingly determined by the relative growthrates of its constituentswhile there are some studies on the role of the microbiome in ipf and lung cancer mostknowledge is based on studies of chronic inflammatory respiratory diseases such as asthma copd andcystic fibrosis generally those patients have increased susceptibility to infections and exacerbations thatagain affect the microbiome h influenzae moraxella catarrhalis and s pneumoniae areassociated with the development of severe asthma and copd they modify the lung

homozygousindividuals have shown associations of single nucleotide polymorphisms with important disease featuresrelated to bacterial colonisation for example gene variants of human leukocyte antigen class ii genesimplicating a role for tcell and bcell immunity associate with age of onset of persistent p aeruginosainfection indicating the role of the host s immune system in selecting a distinct microbiota like the bacterial composition ofthe lung microbiome antiviral responses are altered in chronicrespiratory diseases in asthma where airway epithelial repair in response to viral infection

alterations in the microbiome of the gutmight influence the immune tone of the lung which is shown by the development of more severeexperimental asthma in germfree mice or mice with disturbed microbiomes due to earlylifeantibiotic treatment in contrast the absence of microbiota in germfree mice or due toantibiotic treatment has recently been shown to protect mice with kras mutations and p53 loss from lungcancer development according to the authors this effect was due to the induction of il1Î² andil23 through the microbiota that led to il17 production by Î³Î t cells and tumorigenesisin humans copd patients are two to three times more likely to have crohn s colitis and of peoplewith inflammatory bowel disease also have pulmonary inflammation the gastrointestinal tracthas by far the highest microbial content and thus an interaction of gut microbiota and their metaboliteswith the gastric mucosa affects systemic immunity which may in turn impactthe lung consequently alterations in gut microbiota and physiology might contribute to respiratory disease andvice versa possibly via the gut lung axis however it is important to note that germfree breeding and tosome extent antibiotic treatment will affect both the gut and the lung microbiome so it is still notcompletely clear whether these effects can fully be explained by gut lung crosstalk or if they areinfluenced by aberrant local microbiotaimmune crosstalk along this line in mice the lung immune tonehas been suggested to be more correlated to lung bacteria than gut bacteria in contrast in mice

experimental copd models indicate that reduced gas exchange andhypoxia in the lung is associated with hypoxia in the gut causing colon remodelling cell deathinflammation and impaired barrier function

mousemodels highlighting cause and effect of the gut lung axis in respiratory disease however findings firstneed to be validated in humans before proposing this crosstalk as a treatable trait for respiratory diseasein summary at the host microbiome interface disordered communities are probably both cause andeffects of host inflammation however given the close reciprocal interactions between the microbiome andhost at all times it might be impossible to determine the real cause of the very first changes in diseasedevelopment as host and microbiome factors are coinciding and closely intertwinedimplications for the development of novel therapiesdue to the strong and dynamic interdependency between host and microbiome in local niches it isunsurprising that most drugs used in clinical practice that were designed to target the host also affect themicrobiome accordingly inhaled corticosteroids and proton pump inhibitors affect the lung microbiota as well as subsequent pneumonia risk macrolide antibiotics broadly effective acrosschronic lung conditions such as copd affect both lung microbiota and host immunity perhapsmost provocatively baseline differences in lung microbiota appear to predict patient responsiveness totherapies such as inhaled corticosteroids suggesting that variation in lung microbiota may representan untapped phenotype of precision medicine in the lung this opens new possibilities to exploit thisimportant crosstalk in therapeutic interventions but in order to do so we first need to improve ourunderstanding of the molecular mechanismsincreasing evidence of the importance of the microbiome raises the concept of restoring diseased microbiomes to prevent or treat diseases using microbiotadirected therapies or hosttargeted therapiessuch as probiotics metabolites lung microbiota transplantation or vitamin d therapy which we discusshere in more detailmany clinical studies have investigated the efficacy of probiotic bacteria which are supposedly beneficialfor the host to prevent chronic diseases such as asthma or allergic rhinitis however these studies havelargely produced contradictory outcomes which might be due to the fact that the used probioticswere not selected based on potential mechanistic effects and may not be ideal the microbiome is a10118313993003023202019 0crespiratory basic science r gosens complex ecosystem comprised of a variety of different inhabitants and influenced by many externalhostderived factors thus the addition of single strains may not make a profound difference thus thetransfer of whole microbiomes via faecal microbiota transplantation fmt could be a more promisingapproach the introduction of healthy microbiota into diseased hosts has restored immunity

least a month indicating a potential difficulty in inducing longtermbeneficial changes in the microbiome via only targeting the microbial side while there are encouragingdata questions remain whether fmt may also affectlung health and whether lung microbiotatransplantation is feasible furthermore recently severe complications of fmt have been reported due totransfer of drugresistant bacteria thus it is essential to determine whether such approaches that sofar only transiently change the microbiome can be used for the required longterm treatments of chroniclung diseases that coincide with a variety of structural changes aberrant mucociliary clearance and manymore such as specific microbial moleculeslipopolysaccharide lps andalong with living bacteriapeptidoglycan can induce or modulate inflammatory responsesin addition culturesupernatants of probiotic bacteria display antiinflammatory effects which have been ascribed to thepresence of secreted immunemodulatory metabolites for example culture supernatants of certainprobiotic bifidobacterium species decreased the secretion of type cytokines from immune cell lines andthe expression of costimulatory molecules on primary dendritic cells a likely mechanism is quorumsensing quorum sensing is a means of communication among bacteria of the same species to coordinateeffector functions such as biofilm formation sporulation or toxin secretion the bestdescribed quorumsensing molecules are acyl homoserine lactones ahls several ahls are targeted by the host tointerfere with growth of pathogens and are in turn exploited by bacteria to regulate host geneexpression for their benefit some ahls can bind to distinct bitter taste receptors expressed on the airwayepithelium and innate and adaptive immune cells thereby modulating barrier andimmune functions the moststudied ahl 3oc12hsl can activate phagocytesto increasephagocytosis expression of adhesion receptors and chemotaxis but is itself cleaved andinactivated by airway epithelial cells another example of bacterialderived modulators of the host s immune responses are outer membranevesicles omvs omvs are spherical bilayered membrane vesicles released from the surface of bothgramnegative and grampositive bacteria and contain much of the biological material from the parentbacterium but in a nonreplicative form evidence suggests that the release of omvs providesbacteria with competitive advantages when exposed to acute and chronic hostassociated stressors innate and adaptive immune responses antimicrobialthey may protect bacteria againstpeptides and antibiotics moreover omvs contain factors eg siderophores aiding in theacquisition of nutrients in an environment devoid of crucial elements such as iron besidessupporting the survival of the parent bacteria omvs may also play role in the progression of pulmonarydiseases bacteria frequently associated with copd exacerbations are known to release omvs furthermore macrophages stimulated with omvs derived from prominent airway pathogens such asp aeruginosa h influenzae or m catarrhalis release higher amounts of tumour necrosis factorÎ and il6 legionelladerived omvs significantly enhanced bacterial replication in macrophages andbacteriafree p aeruginosa omvs have been shown to potently induce pulmonary inflammation in mice strengthening the idea that omvs exert diseasepromoting

central to infusing one s caregivingmotivations with positive meaning and consequently nurturing one s wellbeing in the endoflife caregivingjourney these findings are discussed with recommendations for healthcare professionals working with familycaregivers of palliative care patientskeywords palliative care caregiver motivations wellbeing meaning burnout resilience selfdetermination endoflife qualitative research the experience of an endoflife eol family caregivercan be likened to a paradox what could evoke a senseof pleasure appreciation and gratitude could also bringabout feelings of anxiety distress and pain while somehave related the caregiving journey to the metaphor ofascending a mountain the expedition of an eol family caregiver usually spans beyond merely a couple ofdays weeks or months they must navigate the peaks ofdiagnosis to prognosis and eventually death and bereavement in what often unfolds into a lifelong climbthe role of the eol family caregiver is often multifaceted and interminable daily duties involve managingmedical regimes traversing the healthcare system andtaking charge of other dependents alongside providingphysical mental and emotional support throughout theillness trajectory many family caregivers are rarelyequipped with formal or adequate training and nor dothey possess sufficient resources and skills before theyfind themselves embroiled in eol caregiving responsibilities family caregivers must also process and manage amultitude of thoughts and emotions as they come toterms with the changes and sometimes losses in theirpersonal lives this complex experience is not limited to a minorityof people despite strong global advancements in medical technology and healthcare systems older populations remain highly susceptible to chronic and terminalmorbidities that are incapacitating in the unitedstates alone over million caregivers tend to their ailing family members annually while an estimated of patients in europe requiring longterm care areattended to by informal caregivers with the anticipated number of older adults in the world soaring to billion by the year there will certainly be a surging demand for family caregivers to relieve the ensuingresource strains on healthcare settingsthe impact of family caregiving stressors has beenwelldocumented with various studies exploringcaregiver burnout and its effects on the community andsociety complementing these studies are literature thatreveal characteristics of resilience and transformationalgrowth displayed by family caregivers in adversity the common thread that impacts both caregiverburnout and resilience appears to be a lack of or adequate coping a process that requires the individual toconstantly change efforts in both thoughts and behaviorsin order to manage internal or external demands thatare considered stressful despite this indication thatone s psychological resources are key to maintainingone s wellbeing many studies often consider externalfactors such as socioeconomic status accessibility toresources and availability of social support as the primary causation for the degree of caregiver wellbeingthus these studies often recommend pragmatic interventions that focus on improving external circumstancesaccordinglyperception emotion and motivation of the familycaregiverwhile it is undoubtedly beneficial to mitigate

campbell later confirmed this observation in astudy that evaluated multiple variations in the caregiverexperience subjective caregiver burden was repeatedlyidentified as the primary indicator for caregiver stressit was around the same time that folkman andmoskowitz discovered that caregivers experiencepositive emotions alongside negative emotions duringstressful events they put forth the tenet of meaningfocused coping in which caregivers derive mental andemotional sustenance thus effecting positive emotionsin challenging circumstances by deferring to their beliefsvalues and existential

    "text": "These studies demonstrate that RRM1 could be a predictive marker of the response to gemcitabine-based chemotherapy in patients with NSCLC 22 . The present study also showed that the DCR was higher in RRM1-positive patients that received docetaxel or vinorelbine rather than gemcitabine-based therapy. In addition docetaxel and vinorelbine each showed a longer PFS than gemcitabine-based therapy. Simon et al. used RRM1 and ERCC1 as molecular determinants and found that RRM1- and ERCC1-tailored selection of first-line therapy could improve response overall survival (OS) and PFS over standard treatments in patients with NSCLC 23 . These studies suggest that responses to cytotoxic chemotherapy vary greatly in patients with NSCLC and individualized therapy based on RRM1 expression may help improve the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents 24 . Our research was performed retrospectively and this is the major limitation of the study. However the current results provide new information and further insight that can assist clinicians in selecting appropriate and individualized chemotherapy for patients with NSCLC based on RRM1 expression. Several molecular markers have been used as predictive markers of the response to chemotherapy in NSCLC patients. ERCC1 has been used for the prediction of platinum sensitivity in the treatment of NSCLC 6 8 . Park et al. analyzed 217 patients with NSCLC who had received gemcitabine- or taxane-based chemotherapy and found that taxane was associated with a higher response than gemcitabine treatment in patients with EGFR mutations 9 . Another study found that low thymidylate synthase (TS) expression is significantly associated with better clinical outcomes in non-squamous NSCLC patients who were treated with pemetrexed-based chemotherapy 25 . Therefore more prospectively designed studies with combined detection of these markers (RRM1 ERCC1 EGFR and TS) will provide valuable information that will ultimately be used to determine preferable therapeutic approaches for individual patients with NSCLC. In the results of this study suggest that negative RRM1 expression in advanced NSCLC is associated with a higher response rate to gemcitabine-based chemotherapy. Moreover RRM1 may be used as a predictive marker for conventional chemotherapy regimens involving gemcitabine docetaxel and vinorelbine. Additional prospective studies are needed to evaluate the effect of RRM1 expression on the response to various chemotherapeutic regimens in patients with NSCLC.

Although the protein expression levels of p120ctn were not related to E-cadherin the localization (membrane or cytoplasm) of p120ctn was always consistent with that of E-cadherin. We then screened cells expressing high levels of p120ctn and E-cadherin in the membrane (H460 cells) or cytoplasm (SPC cells) as well as those expressing low levels of p120ctn and E-cadherin in the membrane (H4299 cells) or cytoplasm (LK2 cells) for further study (B). .0088064.g002 Expression and localization of p120ctn and E-cadherin in H460 SPC H1299 and LK2 cells. (A) Western blot analyses showed expression of p120ctn and E-cadherin in nine lung cancer cell lines and HBE. (B) By immunofluorescence analysis the expression of E-cadherin and p120ctn were observed restricted to the cell membrane at cell-cell adherens junctions in H460 and H1299 cells whereas they both were confined to the cytoplasm in SPC and LK2 cells. Different functions of p120ctn isoform 1A in EMT are dependent on E-cadherin subcellular localization Knockdown of endogenous p120ctn isoform 1A by siRNA-p120ctn-1A resulted in decreased E-cadherin expression and increased N-cadherin snail and vimentin expression in H460 cells (A). However knockdown of endogenous p120ctn-1A by siRNA-p120ctn-1A showed opposite results in SPC cells where we found increased E-cadherin expression and decreased N-cadherin snail and vimentin expression (B). In comparison with the control the ablation of p120ctn isoform 1A also enhanced the H460 cells invasiveness (17.33 1.25 vs. 36.33 1.70 P 0.01) (C) whereas reduced the SPC cells invasiveness (23.0 0.82 vs. 13.0 0.82 P 0.01) (D). These results revealed that the p120ctn isoform 1A plays a different role in EMT and cell invasiveness in different E-cadherin subcellular locations. .0088064.g003 p120ctn isoform 1A plays a different role in regulating EMT in H460 and SPC cells. (A) Ablation of p120ctn isoform 1A decreased E-cadherin expression and increased N-cadherin snail and vimentin expression in H460 cells. (B) SPC cells were treated as in (A) and the opposite results were obtained. (C) Ablation of p120ctn isoform 1A enhanced the invasiveness of H460 cells ( P 0.01). (D) Ablation of p120ctn isoform 1A decreased the invasiveness of SPC cells ( P 0.01). Inhibitory function of p120ctn isoform 3A on EMT is not affected by differences in E-cadherin subcellular localization To verify whether p120ctn isoforms 1A and 3A play different roles in regulating EMT their expression plasmids were transiently transfected into lung cancer cells with low expression of p120ctn (H1299 with membrane E-cadherin expression and LK2 with cytoplasmic E-cadherin expression). The western-blot analysis demonstrated that overexpression of the p120ctn isoform 1A led to increased E-cadherin expression and decreased N-cadherin vimentin and snail expression (A); on the contrary the decreased E-cadherin expression and increased N-cadherin vimentin and snail expression were observed in LK2 cells (B). Overexpression of the p120ctn isoform 1A also reduced the H1299 cell invasiveness (52.0 2.65 vs. 33.33 2.64 P 0.01) (C) while enhanced the LK2 cell invasiveness (18.0 0.82 vs. 39.66 2.05 P 0.01) (D).. Overexpression of p120ctn isoform 3A led to increased E-cadherin expression decreased N-cadherin vimentin and snail expression (A 4B) and reduced cell invasiveness (52.0 2.65 vs. 29.66 1.53 P 0.01; 18.0 0.82 vs. 8.33 expression 0.47 P 0.01) (C 4D) in both of these cell lines. These results further confirmed that the p120ctn isoform 1A had a different effect on EMT depending on the subcellular localization of E-cadherin. They also revealed that the p120ctn isoform 3A maintained an inhibitory role in the EMT of lung cancer cells whether E-cadherin was localized to the membrane or the cytoplasm. .0088064.g004 p120ctn isoform 3A maintains the role of inhibitiing EMT independently of E-cadherin localization. (A B) Both H1299 (E-cadherin membrane localization) and LK2 cells (E-cadherin cytoplasmic localization) transiently transfected with the p120ctn isoform 3A plasmid showed increased E-cadherin expression and decreased N-cadherin vimentin and snail expression. (C D) Transient transfection of p120ctn isoform 3A plasmids into H1299 and LK2 cells resulted in decreased cell invasiveness ( P 0.01). (E) E-cadherin remained localized on the membrane in H1299 cells and in the cytoplasm of LK2 cells after transfection of the p120ctn isoform 3A plasmid. Discussion The phenomenon of EMT in tumor cells often leads to decreased cell adhesion and increased mobility and this transition is accompanied by decreased E-cadherin expression and increased expression of N-cadherin vimentin and other mesenchymal biomarkers 3 4 5 6 7 . As an important factor for stabilizing E-cadherin p120ctn plays a role in inhibiting or promoting tumor cell proliferation and invasion that is dependent on whether E-cadherin is expressed or not 16 17 . Furthermore p120ctn isoforms 1A and 3A have shown different effects on E-cadherin expression and tumor cell invasiveness which are based on differences in the localization of E-cadherin 18 . These results strongly suggest that p120ctn most likely regulates the EMT of tumor cells by affecting E-cadherin expression and that p120ctn isoforms 1A and 3A play different roles in EMT expressing E-cadherin in different subcellular locations. We first found that the p120ctn membrane expression was positively correlated with E-cadherin expression and negatively correlated with vimentin expression and lymph node metastasis while the cytoplasmic expression of p120ctn was negatively correlated with E-cadherin expression and positively correlated with vimentin expression and lymph node metastasis by immunohistochemistry. Although these results were consistent with previous studies 13 14 they further suggested that p120ctn likely affects the EMT by influencing the expression of E-cadherin and vimentin and thereby the cell invasion and metastasis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). To confirm the different impacts of p120ctn isoforms 1A and 3A on EMT in cells expressing E-cadherin in different locations we selected H460 and H1299 cells with E-cadherin membrane expression and SPC and LK2 cells with E-cadherin cytoplasmic expression for further analysis. Plasmids expressing the p120ctn isoforms 1A and 3A were constructed and the full-length p120ctn siRNA was synthesized for these experiments. Since the sequence beyond amino acids 1 101 of p120ctn isoform 1A is similar to that of p120ctn isoform 3A 24 25 we could not design an interference sequence specifically for p120ctn isoform 3A. Therefore we had to further study the impact of the two isoforms on EMT and cell invasiveness in lung cancer cells with different E-cadherin locations specifically by knocking down p120ctn isoform 1A in H460 and SPC cells with high p120ctn expression and transfecting cDNA plasmids for exogenous p120ctn isoforms 1A and 3A into H1299 and LK2 cells with low expression of p120ctn. Knockdown of p120ctn isoform 1A in H460 cells destroyed the epithelial cell adhesion complexes. E-cadherin expression was also downregulated due to the loss of its important stabilizing factor p120ctn isoform 1A which was consistent with previous studies 20 26 . Decreased E-cadherin expression and disrupted cell-cell adhesion may induce EMT 27 28 43 44 which results in increased N-cadherin vimentin and snail expression and enhanced cell invasiveness. On the other hand overexpressed p120ctn isoforms 1A and 3A was shown to bind E-cadherin located on the membrane proactively in tumor cells 29 and then inhibit the degradation of E-cadherin and stabilize its expression contributing to the formation of effective epithelial cell adhesion complexes 30 31 32 . As these series of processes maintained the normal cell-cell adhesion connection and inhibited EMT there was increased E-cadherin expression and decreased N-cadherin vimentin and snail expression as well as inhibited cell invasiveness in H1299 cells. Previous studies have shown that although p120ctn isoform 1A could bind E-cadherin in the cytoplasm they could not form effective adhesion complexes on the membrane between epithelial cells 33 . Furthermore the cytoplasmic E-cadherin is likely not to be the full-length E-cadherin but instead cleaved E-cadherin fragments such as E-cad sE-cad (80 kDa) and E-cad CTF2 (33 kDa) 34 . The E-cad CTF2 fragment can bind to p120 in the cytoplasm and then translocate into the nucleus and bind the transcriptional repressor of Kaiso to activate the Wnt b-catenin pathway 35 36 finally promoting the EMT of tumor cells and enhancing cell invasion and metastasis 37 . Moreover others have shown that p120ctn-1A is related to abnormal expression of E-cadherin and poor prognosis 38 . These studies illustrated that the cytoplasmic p120ctn isoform 1A can play a role in promoting tumor cell EMT invasion and metastasis. Based on the above we observed on the one hand that the effect of p120ctn isoform 1A to promote tumor cell EMT invasion and metastasis would be lifted by its ablation resulting in increased E-cadherin expression decreased N-cadherin vimentin and snail expression and inhibited invasiveness in SPC cells. On the other hand transfection of the p120ctn isoform 1A plasmid into LK2 cells expressing cytoplasmic E-cadherin resulted in decreased E-cadherin expression increased N-cadherin vimentin and snail expression and enhanced cell invasiveness. Although the precise role of p120ctn during EMT induction is still unclarified previous studies suggested that knockdown of all isoforms of p120ctn could induce EMT indirectly 27 28 43 44 . All inductions were based on decreased E-cadherin expression and intercellular adhesion in previous studies which were also confirmed by our study in H460 cells with E-cadherin membrane localization. Unlike the H460 cells knockdown of the p120ctn isoform 1A in SPC cells with E-cadherin cytoplasmic expression could not decrease E-cadherin expression and intercellular adhesion. Instead we found increased E-cadherin expression and decreased cell invasiveness indicating that the EMT could not be induced by this pathway in SPC cells. It was worth noting that the same result was observed in LK2 and H1299 cells transfected with the p120ctn isoform 3A plasmid both showing increased E-cadherin expression decreased N-cadherin vimentin and snail expression and inhibited cell invasiveness. These results suggested that p120ctn isoform 3A has the function of inhibiting EMT of lung cancer cells and this function is independent of the cellular E-cadherin localization. Past research had also confirmed a shift from p120ctn isoform 3A to p120ctn isoform 1A expression after the induction of EMT 9 10 11 which indirectly indicates that p120ctn isoform 3A may inhibit EMT while p120ctn isoform 1A promotes EMT. In addition we also noticed that p120ctn and E-cadherin protein expression levels were significantly increased after transfection of the p120ctn-3A plasmid into LK2 and H1299 cells but p120ctn and E-cadherin were still mainly restricted to the cell membrane at cell-cell adherens junctions in H1299 cells. By contrast E-cadherin and p120ctn were almost exclusively located in the cytoplasm in LK2 cells (E). As a cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin is known to be only located on the cell membrane with the potential to inhibit EMT while in the cytoplasm it is often cleaved into fragments and therefore functions differently from the molecules located on the cell membrane 34 . Thus the cytoplasmic E-cadherin would theoretically not play a role in inhibiting EMT. Based on the above analysis we speculated that there may be some interaction between p120ctn isoform 3A and snail which plays a role in suppressing EMT in lung cancer cells expressing cytoplasmic E-cadherin but this hypothesis requires further study. Importantly we also found that knockdown of p120ctn-1A in SPC cells with cytoplasmic E-cadherin resulted in decreased twist expression (B). Meanwhile transfection of LK2 cells which also showed cytoplasmic localization of E-cadherin with the p120ctn isoform 1A plasmid resulted in increased twist expression (B). However no changes in twist expression were observed in the rest of the experiments (A 4A). As a transcription factor and master gene regulator of EMT 39 40 twist can downregulate E-cadherin expression 41 and upregulate N-cadherin and other mesenchymal biomarkers 42 . Increased twist expression in LK2 cells transfected with the p120ctn isoform 1A plasmid indicated that transcriptional activation took place and further suggested that the p120ctn isoform 1A may have translocated into the nucleus upon binding of E-cad CTF2 in the cytoplasm consequently activating the Wnt signaling pathway to promote EMT. Decreased twist expression in SPC cells transfected with p120ctn-1A-siRNA indicated that transcriptional activity was downregulated and suggested that ablation of p120ctn isoform 1A resulted in the inhibtion of EMT by removing the stimulatory effect of the Wnt signaling activity by p120ctn isoform 1A. In the H460 and H1299 cells with E-cadherin localized in the membrane the unchanged twist expression confirmed that p120ctn isoforms 1A and 3A could bind to E-cadherin and maintain effective cell-cell adhesion in order to suppress EMT instead of affecting the Wnt twist pathway. Intriguingly overexpression of p120ctn isoform 3A did not change twist expression in LK2 cells expressing cytoplasmic E-cadherin indicating that p120ctn isoform 3A did not activate transcription. Therefore we firmly believe in the above hypothesis that p120ctn isoform 3A may interact with snail in some manner to influence E-cadherin expression and suppress EMT in lung cancer cells carrying cytoplasmic E-cadherin. Previous studies have observed that p120ctn-1A restored the cytoplasmic expression of E-cadherin whereas p120ctn-3A could not 20 which seems to be contradictory with the results of this study. However the method in previous studies of knocking down p120ctn expression and then transfecting p120ctn isoforms 1A and 3A plasmids into cells is different from that in the current study in which cells were only transiently transfected with p120ctn isoforms 1A and 3A plasmids. Therefore the different research methods may have led to different effects on E-cadherin. We also noted that in previous studies decreased and almost undetectable levels of E-cadherin by ablation of p120ctn resulted in the failure of exogenous p120ctn-1A to translocate into the nucleus to activate the Wnt b-catenin pathway and decrease E-cadherin expression due to the deletion of the binding partner E-cad CTF2. However the LK2 and H1299 cell lines used in these experiments expressed E-cadherin in the present study. E-cadherin binds primarily to unphosphorylated p120ctn isoform 3A whereas tyrosine-phosphorylated p120ctn isoform 1A interacts exclusively with N-cadherin 23 . In the previous studies exogenous p120ctn isoform 3A was prevented from binding and stabilizing E-cadherin after its ablation while in the present study the exogenous p120ctn isoform 3A could stabilize E-cadherin expression directly on the membrane or indirectly by increasing its cytoplasmic expression via regulation of snail expression. Of course all of these findings will need to be further investigated. In conclusion we for the first time found that p120ctn isoforms 1A and 3A to have different functions in EMT of lung cancer cells with E-cadherin expressed in different subcellular locations. When E-cadherin was localized on the cell membrane p120ctn isoforms 1A and 3A both could inhibit EMT and reduce the cell invasiveness phenotype.",
